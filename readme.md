# Trump Speeches
## Intro

This project's aim is to use some basic Natural language processing, the text blob library,
to examine Trump's speeches. This project is more of a proof of concept in that I did not
focus on ensuring that the sentences, within each speech, are 100% clean - meaning some 
of them have white spaces within them. Finally, I added some of Obama's speeches throughout 
his career to compare them to Trumps.
