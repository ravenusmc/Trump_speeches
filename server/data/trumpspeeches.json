   "text": "thank you, everybody. so great to be with you. thank you. great to be back at cpac. it.s a place i have really.“.“ audience member. we love you! the president. i have.“i love this place. love you people. so thank you. thank you very much. first of all, i want to thank matt schlapp, and his very, very incredible wife.“and boss.“[laughter].“mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great. when i watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance. so, i want to thank matt and mercedes. and when matt called and asked, i said, absolutely, i.ll be there with you. i mean, the real reason i said it: i didn.t want him to go against me, because that one you can.t beat. so i said, absolutely. and it really is an honor to be here. i wouldn.t miss a chance to talk to my friends. these are my friends. and we.ll see you again next year and the year after that, and i.ll be doing this with cpac whenever i can, and i.ll make sure that we.re here a lot. you know, if you remember, my first major speech.“sit down, everybody. come on. [laughter] you know, the dishonest media, they.ll say he didn.t get a standing ovation. you know why. [laughter] no, you know why. because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation, right. that.s the way they work. [applause] they are the worst. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. so sit down. [laughter] .donald trump did not get a standing ovation.. they leave out the part, they never sat down. they leave that out. so i just want to thank.“but you know, my first major speech was at cpac. and probably, 5 or 6 years ago.“first major political speech. and you were there. and it was.“i loved it. i love the people. i love the commotion. and then, they did these polls where i went through the roof, and i wasn.t even running, right. but it gave me an idea, and i got a little bit concerned when i saw what was happening in the country, and i said, let.s go to it. so it was very exciting. i walked the stage on cpac. i.ll never forget it, really. i had very little notes and even less preparation. so when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, i said, i think i like this business. i would have come last year, but i was worried that i would be, at that time, too controversial. we wanted border security. we wanted very, very strong military. we wanted all of the things that we.re going to get, and people considered that controversial. but you didn.t consider it controversial. so i.ve been with cpac for a long time. all of these years, we.ve been together. and now you finally have a president. finally. took you a long time. [applause] took you a long time. and it.s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me.“believe me. you did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make america great again. the media didn.t think we would win. audience member. they knew. [laughter] the president. the pundits.“you.re right. they had an idea. the pundits didn.t think we.d win. the consultants that suck up all that money. oh, they suck it up, they.re so good. [laughter] they.re not good at politics, but they.re really good at sucking up people.s money. especially my opponent.s, because i kept them down to a minimum. but the consultants didn.t think we would win. but they all underestimated the power of the people, you. and the people proved them totally wrong. never.“and this is so true, and this is what.s been happening.“never underestimate the people. never. i don.t think it will ever happen again. and i want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. it.s fake, phony, fake. a few days ago, i called the fake news .the enemy of the people,. and they are. they are the enemy of the people. because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. i saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. there are no nine people. i don.t believe there was one or two people. nine people. and i said, give me a break. because i know the people. i know who they talked to. there were no nine people. but they say, nine people, and somebody reads it, and they think, oh, nine people. they have nine sources. they make up sources. they are very dishonest people. in fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that i called the fake news the enemy of the people.“the fake news. they dropped off the word .fake.. and all of a sudden, the story became, the media is the enemy. they take the word .fake. out, and now i.m saying, oh, no, this is no good. [laughter] but that.s the way they are. so i.m not against the media. i.m not against the press. i don.t mind bad stories if i deserve them. and i tell you, i love good stories, but we won.t talk.“[laughter].“i don.t get too many of them. but i am only against the fake news media or press.“fake, fake. they have to lead that word. i.m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. they shouldn.t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody.s name. let their name be put out there. let their name be put out. .a source says that donald trump is a horrible, horrible human being.. let them say it to my face. let there be no more sources. and remember this.“and in.“not all in all cases. i mean, i had a story written yesterday about me in reuters by a very honorable man. it was a very fair story. there are some great reporters around. they.re talented; they.re honest as the day is long. they.re great. but there are some terrible, dishonest people, and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. a tremendous disservice. they are very dishonest people, and they shouldn.t use sources. they should put the name of the person. you will see stories dry up like you.ve never seen before. [laughter] so you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story.“and i put myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, you.re not part of the story, and if you.re not part of the story, then you sort of know. if you are part of the story, you know what they.re saying is true or not. so when they make it up, and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election.“polls, polls. the polls. they come out with these polls, and everybody was so surprised. actually, a couple of polls got it right. i must say, los angeles times did a great job. shocking, because.“you know. [laughter] they did a great job. and we had a couple of others that were right. but generally speaking, i mean, i can tell you the network. somebody said a poll came out. and i say, what network is it. and they.ll say, a certain.“let.s not even mention names right. should we. well, you have a lot of them. look, the .clinton news network. is one. [laughter] totally. take a look. honestly. take a look at their polls over the last 2 years. now, you.d think they.d fire the pollster, right. after years and years of getting battered. but i don.t.“i mean, who knows, maybe they.re just bad at polling. or maybe they.re not legit. but it.s one or the other. look at how inaccurate.“look at cbs, look at abc also. look at nbc. take a look at some of these polls. they.re so bad, so inaccurate. and what that does is, it creates a false narrative. it creates, like, this narrative that.s just, like, we.re not going to win, and people say: .oh, i love trump, but you know i.m not feeling great today. he can.t win. so i won.t go and vote. i won.t go and vote.. it creates a whole false deal, and we have to fight it folks. we have to fight it. they.re very smart, they.re very cunning, and they.re very dishonest. so just to conclude, i mean, it.s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories. they say that we can.t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the first amendment. you know, they always bring up the first amendment. [laughter] and i love the first amendment. nobody knows.“loves it better than me. nobody. i mean, who uses it more than i do. but the first amendment gives all of us.“it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all americans.“the right to speak our minds freely. it gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly. and many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it.s not your agenda, and it.s not the country.s agenda. it.s their own agenda. they have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. but as you saw throughout the entire campaign.“and even now.“the fake news doesn.t tell the truth. doesn.t tell the truth. so just in finishing, i say it doesn.t represent the people. it never will represent the people. and we.re going to do something about it, because we have to go out, and we have to speak our minds, and we have to be honest. our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. and i.m here fighting for you, and i will continue to fight for you. the victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law. our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values. and our victory was a win for everyone who believes it.s time to stand up for america, to stand up for the american worker, and to stand up for the american flag. yes, there we should stand up. come on. [applause] there we should stand up. okay. and by the way, we love our flag. and by the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed; there are lines that go back six blocks. and i tell you that because you won.t read about it, okay. [laughter] but there are lines that go back six blocks. there is such love in this country for everything we stand for. you saw that on election day. and you.re going to see it more and more. so we.re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. there.s never been anything like this. there.s been some movements, but there.s never been anything like this. there.s been some movements that petered out, like bernie.“petered out. [laughter] but it was a little rigged against him.“you know, superdelegate, superdelegate. she had so many delegates before the thing even started. i actually said to my people, how does that happen. [laughter] not that i.m a fan of bernie, but a lot of bernie people voted for trump. you know why. because he.s right on one issue: trade. he was right about trade. our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. so he was right about that, but we got a lot of bernie support. so actually, i like bernie, okay. i like bernie. but i.m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the republican party and for the future of america. first, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. the core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. for too long, we.ve traded away our jobs to other countries.“so terrible. we.ve defended other nations. borders while leaving ours wide open; anybody can come in. audience members. build a wall! build it! the president. oh, we.re going to build the wall, don.t worry about it. we.re building the wall. we.re building the wall. in fact, it.s going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule. [applause] it.s way, way, way ahead of schedule. it.s going to start very soon. general kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job. fantastic job he.s done. and remember, we are getting the bad ones out. these are bad dudes. we.re getting the bad ones out, okay. we.re getting the bad.“if you watch these people it.s like, oh, gee, that.s so sad. we.re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn.t be.“whether it.s drugs or murder or other things. we.re getting bad ones out. those are the ones that go first, and i said it from day one. basically, all i.ve done is keep my promise. we.ve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. in the middle east, we.ve spent, as of 4 weeks ago, $6 trillion. think of it. audience members. boo! the president. and by the way, the middle east is in worse.“i mean, it.s not even close.“it.s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. if our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now. that i can tell you. be a hell of a lot better. we could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. this is the situation that i inherited. i inherited a mess, believe me. we also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. now, i.ve been watching.“and nobody says it.“but obamacare doesn.t work, folks. it.s.“i mean, i could say.“i could talk.“it doesn.t work. and now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you.re watching, they.re not you. they.re largely, many of them are, the side that lost. you know, they lost the election. it.s, like, how many elections do we have to have. they lost the election. [laughter] but i always say, obamacare doesn.t work. and these same people, 2 years and a year ago, were complaining about obamacare. and the bottom line: we.re changing it. we.re going to make it much better. we.re going to make it less expensive. we.re going to make it much better. obamacare covers very few people. and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved, that was taken away from them; it was taken away from them. millions of people were very happy with their health care. they had their doctor; they had their plan. remember the lie.“28 times: .you can keep your doctor; you can keep your plan..“over and over and over again you heard it. so we.re going to repeal and replace obamacare. and i tell paul ryan and all of the folks that we.re working with very hard.“dr. tom price, very talented guy.“but i tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. let it implode completely. it.s already imploding; you see the carriers are all leaving. i mean, it.s a disaster. but 2 years, don.t do anything. the democrats will come to us and beg for help. they.ll beg, and it.s their problem. but it.s not the right thing to do for the american people. it.s not the right thing to do. we inherited a national debt that has doubled in 8 years. think of it.“$20 trillion. it.s doubled. and we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. we don.t win anymore. when was the last time we won. do we win a war. do we win anything. audience member. when you got elected! the president. do we win anything. we.re going to win. we.re going to win big, folks. we.re going to start winning again, believe me. we.re going to win. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. but we.re taking a firm, bold, and decisive measure.“we have to.“to turn things around. the era of empty talk is over. it.s over. now is the time for action. so let me tell you about the actions that we.re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the american people and on my promise to make america great again. we.ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the united states and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall. by doing this.“and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ice, with the help of general kelly, and all of the people that are so passionate about this.“our border patrol, i.ll tell you what they do. they came and endorsed me; ice came and endorsed me. they never endorsed a presidential candidate before. they might not even be allowed to. [laughter] but they were disgusted with what they saw. and we.ll stop it. we.ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. pouring in, pouring in. we get the drugs; they get the money. we get the problems; they get the cash. no good, no good. going to stop. by stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that.s so important because the tax.“the dollars that we.re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. and the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling american communities, including our inner cities. we are also going to save countless american lives. as we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, and the criminal aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country. and we will not let them back in. they.re not coming back in, folks. if they do, they.re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of. i.m also working with the department of justice to begin reducing violent crime. i mean, can you believe what.s happening in chicago, as an example. two days ago, seven people were shot.“.“ audience member. chiraq! [laughter] the president. .“.“and, i believe, killed. seven people. seven people. chicago, a great american city. seven people shot and killed. we will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [applause] thank you. and thank them. i.ve also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn america from the trans-pacific partnership so that we can protect our economic freedom. and we are going to make trade deals, but we.re going to do one-on-one, one-on-one. and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal. and then, they.ll come back, and we.ll make a better deal. none of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster. just take a look.“by the way, take a look at nafta, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development. it.s economic undevelopment, as far as our country is concerned. we.re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare. we.re going to save americans from this crisis and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. we have authorized the construction, one day, of the keystone and dakota access pipelines and issued a new rule. this took place while i was getting ready to sign. i said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline. well, sir, it comes from all over the world. isn.t that wonderful. i said, nope, it comes from the united states, or we.re not building it. american steel. if they want a pipeline in the united states, they.re going to use pipe that.s made in the united states, do we agree. but can you imagine.“i told this story the other day.“can you imagine the gentleman.“never met him, don.t even know the name of his company. i actually sort of know it, but i want to get it exactly correct. big, big, powerful company. they spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline.“same thing with the dakota, different place. they got their approvals, everything, in the case of dakota, then all of a sudden, they couldn.t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. but with the keystone, so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking the blood out of the company.“.don.t worry..“i.ve used them all my life, okay.“.don.t worry, we.re going to get it approved, i.m connected, i.m a lobbyist, don.t worry.. bottom line, obama didn.t sign it. right. could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there. a lot of jobs. didn.t sign it. but can you imagine. he gave up. a year ago, it was dead. now he.s doing nothing, calling his wife, .hello, darling, i.m a little bored, you know that pipeline.. that has killed us, that has killed our company. knock, knock. .mr. so-and-so, the keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere, has just been approved.. now, can you imagine the expression. and you know the sad part. the same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed. they.re now going to go back to him and say, didn.t we do a great job. we want more money, right, because that.s the way the system works. a little bit off, but that.s the way the system works. we.re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on american energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and beautiful clean coal, and we.re going to put our miners back to work. miners are going back to work. miners are going back to work, folks. sorry to tell you that, but they.re going back to work. we have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy.“crushing. and not only our economy, crushing our jobs, because companies can.t hire. we.re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. and by the way, i want regulation. i want to protect our environment. i want regulations for safety. i want all of the regulations that we need, and i want them to be so strong and so tough. but we don.t need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries. that we don.t need. but we.re going to have regulations. it.s going to be really strong and really good, and we.re going to protect our environment, and we.re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers. okay. another major promise is tax reform. we are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on american business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. [applause] thank you. in anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country. you see that. in fact, i think i did more than any other pre-president.“they say president-elect. president-elect is meeting with ford; he.s meeting with chrysler; he.s meeting with general motors. i just wanted to save a little time. [laughter] because ford and fiat-chrysler, general motors, sprint, intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the united states, expanding production and hiring more workers. and they.re going back to michigan, and they.re going back to ohio, and they.re going back to pennsylvania, and they.re going back to north carolina and to florida. it.s time for all americans to get off of welfare and get back to work. you.re going to love it! you.re going to love it. [applause] you are going to love it. we.re also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military. and we will be substantially upgrading all of our military.“all of our military.“offensive, defensive, everything. bigger and better and stronger than ever before. and hopefully, we.ll never have to use it. but nobody is going to mess with us, folks. nobody. it will be one of the greatest military buildups in american history. no one will dare to question.“as they have been, because we.re very depleted, very, very depleted. sequester. sequester. nobody will dare question our military might again. we believe in peace through strength, and that.s what we will have. as part of my pledge to restore safety for the american people, i have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate isis. working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the earth. at the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. foreign terrorists will not be able to strike america if they cannot get into our country. and by the way, take a look at what.s happening in europe, folks. take a look at what.s happening in europe. i took a lot of heat on sweden. [laughter] and then, a day later, i said, has anybody reported what.s going on. audience member. no, they haven.t. the president. and it turned out that they didn.t.“not too many of them did. [laughter] take a look at what happened in sweden. i love sweden. great country. great people. i love sweden. but they understand i.m right. the people over there understand i.m right. take a look at what.s happening in sweden. take a look at what.s happening in germany. take a look at what.s happened in france. take a look at nice and paris. i have a friend; he.s a very, very substantial guy. he loves the city of lights. he loves paris. for years, every year, during the summer, he would go to paris.“it was automatic.“with his wife and his family. i hadn.t seen him in a while. and i said, jim, let me ask you a question: how.s paris doing. .paris. i don.t go there anymore. paris is no longer paris.. that was 4 years.“4, 5 years.“hasn.t gone there. he wouldn.t miss it for anything. now he doesn.t even think in terms of going there. take a look at what.s happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart. we have to be smart. we can.t let it happen to us. so let me state this as clearly as i can: we are going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. we will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brandnew action to protect out people and keep america safe. you will see the action. i will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the american people. i won.t do it. if it means i get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it.s okay. it doesn.t bother me. the security of our people is number one.“is number one. our administration is running with great efficiency, even though i still don.t have my cabinet approved. nobody mentions that. do you know i still have people out there waiting to be approved. and everyone knows they.re going to be approved. it.s just a delay, delay, delay. it.s really sad. it.s really sad. and these are great people. these are some great people. we still don.t have our cabinet. i assume we.re setting records for that. that.s the only thing good about it is, we.re setting records. i love setting records. but i hate having a cabinet meeting, and i see all these empty seats. i said, democrats, please, approve our cabinet and get smart on health care too, if you don.t mind. [laughter] but we.re taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science, and industry. yesterday i had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office: caterpillar tractor, campbell.s soup. we had everybody. we had everybody. i like campbell.s soup. [laughter] we had everybody, and we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big massive new plants and lots of jobs. and you know what. they.re going to be building them in this country, not in some other country. we.re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement, and we.re meeting with leaders from all around the world, where the white house doors used to be totally closed.“they were closed, folks. you don.t realize that. they were closed. audience member. he was afraid. the president. they.re now wide open. and they.re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. and when they come into the white house, we.re translating these meetings into action. one by one, we.re checking off the promises we made to the people of the united states. one by one, a lot of promises. and we will not stop until the job is done. we will reduce your taxes. we will cut your regulations. we will support our police. we will defend our flag. we will rebuild our military. we will take care of our great, great veterans. we.re taking care of our veterans. we will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good.“none of them. you wonder, where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. where did they come from. audience member. government. the president. well, they came also from campaign contributions, i must be honest with you. [laughter] they.re not as stupid as you think. [laughter] we will cut wasteful spending. we will promote our values. we will rebuild our inner cities. we will bring back our jobs and our dreams. audience member. amen! the president. so true. so true. and by the way, we will protect our second amendment very well. you know, wayne and chris are here from the nra, and they didn.t have that on the list. it.s lucky i thought about it. [laughter] but we will indeed. and they.re great people. and by the way, they love our country. they love our country. the nra has been a great supporter. they love our country. the forgotten men and women of america will be forgotten no longer. that is the heart of this new movement and the future of the republican party. people came to vote, and these people.“the media.“they said, where are they coming from. what.s going on here. these are hard-working, great, great americans. these are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. hillary called them .deplorable.. audience members. boo! the president. they.re not deplorable. audience members. lock her up! lock her up! lock her up! the president. who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly. [laughter] that.s the problem in politics. one wrong word and it.s over. she also said .irredeemable,. but we won.t mention that. [laughter] the gop will be, from now on, the party also of the american worker. you know, we haven.t been, as a group, given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle. during the early days when we had 17 people running.“the primaries.“millions and millions of people were joining. now, i won.t say it was because of me, but it was, okay. [laughter] and we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see america be great again, and it will see it. and it.s going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me. a lot sooner than you think. we will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the united states of america, believe me. global cooperation.“dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries.“is good. it.s very important. but there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. this is the united states of america that i.m representing. i.m not representing the globe. i.m representing your country. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. there is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to america. america.“it.s the allegiance to america. no matter our background or income or geography, we are all citizens of this blessed land. and no matter our color or the blood.“the color of the blood we bleed, it.s the same red blood of great, great patriots. remember. great patriots. we all salute, with pride, the same american flag. and we are equal.“totally equal.“in the eyes of almighty god. we.re equal. [applause] thank you. and i want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the christian community. communities of faith.“rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers.“because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for trump. so i want to thank you folks. it was amazing.“an amazing outpouring, and i will not disappoint you. as long as we have faith in each other, and trust in god, then there is no goal, at all, beyond our reach. there is no dream too large, no task too great. we are americans, and the future belongs to us. the future belongs to all of you. and america is coming about, and it.s coming back, and it.s roaring, and you can hear it. it.s going to be bigger and better. it is going to be. it is going to be. remember. and it.s roaring. it.s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. i want to thank you. and matt and mercedes, i want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that i have. i see them. they.re all over the place. you are really great people. i want to thank you. and i want to say to you, god bless you.“.“ audience member. god bless you! the president. .“.“and god bless the united states of america. thank you, folks. thank you."

   "text": "vice president michael r. pence. well, good evening to you all. fellow americans, irish friends, distinguished guests: i.m mike pence, and i.m the 48th vice president of the united states of america. and it is my honor.“[applause].“it.s my honor, along with my wife, karen pence, to welcome you on behalf of the first family to the white house on this very special occasion. it is such an honor for the two of us to be able to welcome you here and welcome a special guest to the white house and, of course, our host to this podium for this 55-year-old tradition. since irish ambassador john joseph hearne left a box of ireland.s most famous symbol at the white house in 1952, the shamrock exchange has grown to become a festive sign of enduring friendship during this memorable week and an eternal bond between the american people and the people of ireland. now, the irish are one of the strongest and most beautiful threads in our national fabric here in the united states. for centuries, the sons and daughters of ireland have come here from across the atlantic. more than 32 million americans now trace their heritage back to the emerald isle. and i say with a grateful heart and deep humility, i.m one of them. my grandfather, richard michael cowley, stepped off a boat onto ellis island in 1923. and that.s how michael richard pence got to serve in the white house. my grandfather, as the legend of our family says, was told by my great-grandmother that he needed to go to america. she said, there.s a future there for you. he wouldn.t see his mother for 25 years, and he often spoke of their separation with a heavy heart. my grandfather came here, like so many generations of irish americans did, with a dream, but with character and with work ethic and a determination to build a family, a good name. and so he did. my mother, who is 83 years young, bright red hair and blue eyes, is still with us today, and his memory and her influence continues to define my life, the truth is my grandfather was very typical of the millions that would come to these shores. he embodied all that.s best about the irish: sturdy work ethic, faith in god, love of family, patriotism. and that.“those are the enduring contributions of people of irish descent in the history of this country. it.s extraordinary to think of the contributions that the irish have made. in every single american conflict since our revolutionary war, the irish people have enriched america in incalculable ways, and they always will. and when i speak of those character qualities i know that they apply to the two people that we have the privilege of introducing tonight. first is our special guest. it.s my high honor to invite him to the podium, along with our host. so, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the taoiseach of the republic of ireland, enda kenny; his wife fionnuala; and my friend, the 45th president of the united states of america, donald trump. the president. thank you very much. it.s a great honor. taoiseach, mrs. kenny, ambassador anderson, dr. lowe, vice president pence, and distinguished guests: we gather here today in the white house to take part in the traditional shamrock ceremony and to celebrate the strong ties between the united states and a truly great country, ireland. i also want to extend a special welcome to a group of distinguished local political and society leaders.“and they are real leaders.“who are with us from northern ireland.“great people.“including the mayor of belfast and the head of northern ireland civil service.“that.s a lot of power there. [laughter] lord mayor kingston and sir malcolm mckibbin, and it.s wonderful to have you. where are you folks? where are you? where are you? thank you. and they.re going to be having a great open championship very soon. i know that, right? [laughter] at a great course. at a great, great course. st. patrick.s day has become a truly important occasion in the united states, one embraced by americans of all faiths and of all backgrounds. i.ve been to many of them, and we love it. the shamrock ceremony is a tradition that symbolizes the bond between our two countries. it dates back to 1952 when the irish ambassador to the united states, john joseph hearne, sent a box of shamrocks to a president who did a very good job, harry s. truman. our strong ties go back throughout american history. irish-americans played a vital role in preserving our union during its hour of greatest need. so true. they played a very, very big role. many distinguished themselves in the american civil war with their grit and their bravery and their courage, earning the nickname, the .fighting irish.. and i know a lot about the irish. they fight. they are tough. [laughter] i know a lot. i know more than i.m ever going to tell you. [laughter] and when american armed forces joined the fight in europe during world war ii, 75 years ago, our heroic troops first stepped off ships in belfast harbor in northern ireland. throughout the centuries, hard-working irish americans contributed mightily to america.s innovation and to america.s prosperity. they often overcame great hardship.“and it.s really, i mean, it.s like, the hardship they overcame for us, for our people, is inspiring and really helped a relatively young nation beyond what anyone really understands or knows. so we want to thank you. just an amazing, an amazing history. president john f. kennedy, in an address to the irish parliament, said that .it is that quality of the irish.“that remarkable combination of hope, confidence, and imagination.“that is needed more than ever today.. now, he said that a long time ago, but it.s perhaps even more true today. the words of america.s first irish catholic president ring just as true. we hope confidence.“and i tell you, what we want now is a lot of things, but we need that great irish confidence.“and they are confident people, aren.t they, mike? and we.“and i tell you what, we all want it together to grow in the 21st century. and grow we will, as i say, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. we must have the hope to believe in a better future, the confidence to pursue it, and the imagination to figure out how to get there. a new optimism is sweeping across our nation. you see that when you look at the numbers; the optimism is at the highest level in many, many years. and as america gains renewed strength, ireland will find us to be an ever-faithful partner and an always loyal friend. we will be there for you, and we will be there for you. so thank you for being here. i wish you a very, very happy st. patrick.s day. and god bless you and may god bless ireland and northern ireland. [applause] okay? and may god bless america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much. prime minister kenny. thank you. mr. president, mr. vice president, ladies and gentlemen: it.s a great honor to be back again in the most famous house in the world to celebrate st. patrick.s day, the most special of days for irish men and irish women and those of irish descent the world over. since i had the privilege of being elected as taoiseach in 2011, i.ve had the pleasure of being here in the white house each march to mark the enduring connections between our country and the united states. fionnuala and i would like sincerely to thank president trump for so graciously continuing this great tradition of hospitality which means so much to irish people everywhere. i.m proud, sir, to have the opportunity to contribute to maintaining and developing relations between ireland and the united states, particularly at the beginning of the new era in our country.s relationship following your election, mr. president. let me congratulate you and wish you and your administration the very best as you begin your term of office. this job, the job you hold, is exceptionally demanding and exceptionally difficult. the united states remains the most influential, as well as the most powerful, country in the world. you hold the hopes and the future of america.“and indeed, the world.“in your hands. but let me thank you for giving so much of your time today to this visit. we had an excellent meeting, a first-class meeting this morning in the oval office.“not there very often.“[laughter].“where we discussed a variety of important issues of mutual concern. and i want to assure you, sir, of our commitment to working closely with you and your administration as you face the many challenges up ahead. the ties that bind our two countries are deep and historic. and ireland and the united states have a unique relationship that goes back to the earliest days of the original 13 colonies. irish-born military officers assisted george washington to win that war of independence. indeed, they.ve fought in every war for america since then. and this very house was designed by james hoban from kilkenny, modeled in part after the leinster house in dublin, where the irish parliament has met on our own independence since 1922. it.s fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate st. patrick and his legacy. he, too, of course, was an immigrant. and though he is, of course, the patron saint of ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also a symbol of.“indeed, the patron of.“immigrants. here in america, in your great country, 35 million people claim irish heritage, and the irish have contributed to the economic, social, political, and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. ireland came to america because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, of even food itself, the irish believed. and four decades before lady liberty lifted her lamp, we were the .wretched refuse on the teeming shore.. we believed in the shelter of america, in the compassion of america, in the opportunity of america. we came, and we became americans. we lived the words of john f. kennedy long before he uttered them: we asked not what america could do for us, but what we could do for america. and we still do. we want to give and not to take. we know the irish have built the bridges and the roads, protected the public as firefighters and police officers. we.ve cared for the sick in hospitals, entertained as poets, as singers, and writers, as politicians, as judges and legislators. and as entrepreneurs, they provided hundreds of thousands of jobs for americans, including most recently, in exciting technology companies. two-way trade in goods is approaching $100 billion a year at the moment. irish firms employ 100,000 people across 50 states in the u.s. and we want to build on this for the future. mr. president, ireland is a small island on the edge of europe, a natural bridge between the united states and europe, and as a committed member of the european union and a close friend of the united states, we will work hard with you, mr. president, and with your administration in pursuit of strong and open relations between the united states and the european union, including the strong trade relationships for the mutual benefit of millions of people either side of the atlantic. i believe that the strong people-to-people links that ireland and the united states have developed over the generations will help us in this endeavor. and i wish you and the american people every success and happiness in the future. to irish americans, coast to coast, i say.“in these days especially.“we hold you in our hearts. and tonight i thank you again for your warm hospitality. mr. president, mr. vice president, may i wish you and your lovely families every good wish and blessing on this very special day. indeed, i.m reminded in many ways of the dream of another american president.“which ireland will walk with you with.“when he spoke the words and said, .my dream is of a place and a time where america will once again be seen as the last, best hope of earth.. spoken by abraham lincoln. mr. president, ireland will help you build on that foundation to achieve the ultimate dream. thank you, sir. and god bless you."

   "text": "thank you, chris, for that kind introduction and for your tremendous work on behalf of our second amendment. thank you very much. i want to also thank wayne lapierre for his unflinching leadership in the fight for freedom. wayne, thank you very much. great. i.d also like to congratulate karen handel on her incredible fight in georgia six. the election takes place on june 20. and by the way, on primaries, let.s not have 11 republicans running for the same position, okay? [laughter] it.s too nerve-shattering. she.s totally for the nra, and she.s totally for the second amendment. so get out and vote. she.s running against someone who.s going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your health care, and he.s for open borders.“lots of crime.“and he.s not even able to vote in the district that he.s running in. other than that, i think he.s doing a fantastic job, right? [laughter] so get out and vote for karen. also, my friend.“he.s become a friend.“because there.s nobody that does it like lee greenwood. wow. [laughter] lee.s anthem is the perfect description of the renewed spirit sweeping across our country. and it really is, indeed, sweeping across our country. so, lee, i know i speak for everyone in this arena when i say, we are all very proud indeed to be an american. thank you very much, lee. no one was more proud to be american than the beloved patriot.“and you know who i.m talking about.“we remember on gatherings like today, your former five-term president, the late charlton heston. how good was charlton? and i remember charlton; he was out there fighting when maybe a lot of people didn.t want to be fighting. he was out there for a long time. he was a great guy. and it.s truly wonderful to be back in atlanta and back with my friends at the nra. you are my friends, believe me. perhaps some of you remember the last time we were all together. remember that? [laughter] we had a big crowd then too. so we knew something was happening. but it was in the middle of a historic political year and in the middle of a truly historic election. what fun that was: november 8. wasn.t that a great evening? do you remember that evening? remember that? remember they were saying, .we have breaking news: donald trump has won the state of michigan.. they go, .michigan? how did that..“.donald trump has won the state of wisconsin, whoa.. but earlier in the evening, remember: florida, north carolina, south carolina, pennsylvania, all the way up.“we ran up the east coast. and you know, the republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college; you know that. and tremendous disadvantage. and to run the whole east coast, and then you go with iowa and ohio, and all of the different states. it was a great evening, one that a lot people will never forget.“a lot of people. [laughter] not going to forget that evening. and remember they said, .there is no path to 270.. for months, i was hearing that. you know, they.re trying to suppress the vote. so they keep saying it; so people say, you know, i really like trump, he loves the second amendment, he loves the nra; i love him, but let.s go to the movie, because he can.t win. because they.re trying to suppress the vote. but they.d say.“i mean, hundreds of times i heard.“there is no.“there.s no route. they.d say it, .there is no route to 270.. and we ended up with 306. so they were right: not 270, 306. that was some evening. big sports fans said that was the single most exciting event they.ve ever seen. that includes super bowls and world series and boxing matches. that was an exciting evening for all of us, and it meant a lot. only one candidate in the general election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the president of the united states, standing before you again. i have a feeling that in the next election you.re going to be swamped with candidates, but you.re not going to be wasting your time. [laughter] you.ll have plenty of those democrats coming over, and you.re going to say, no, sir, no thank you.“no, ma.am. perhaps ma.am. it may be pocahontas, remember that. [laughter] and she is not big for the nra, that i can tell you. but you came through for me, and i am going to come through for you. i was proud to receive the nra.s earliest endorsement in the history of the organization. and today i am also proud to be the first sitting president to address the nra leadership forum since our wonderful ronald reagan in 1983. and i want to thank each and every one of you, not only for your help electing true friends of the second amendment, but for everything you do to defend our flag and our freedom. with your activism, you helped to safeguard the freedoms of our soldiers who have bled and died for us on the battlefields. and i know we have many veterans in the audience today, and we want to give them a big, big beautiful round of applause. and like i promised, we are doing a really top job already.“99 days.“but already, with the veterans administration, people are seeing a big difference. we are working really hard at the va, and you.re going to see it, and you.re already seeing it. and it.s my honor. i.ve been telling you we.re going to do it, and we.re doing it. thank you. the nra protects in our capitols and legislative houses the freedoms that our servicemembers have won for us on those incredible battlefields. and it.s been a tough fight against those who would go so far as to ban private gun ownership entirely. but i am here to deliver you good news. and i can tell you that wayne and chris have been fighting with me long and hard to make sure that we were with you today, not somebody else with an empty podium. because believe me, the podium would have been empty. they fought long and hard, and i think you folks cannot thank them enough. they were with us all the way, right from the beginning. but we have news that you.ve been waiting for for a long time: the 8-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. you have a true friend and champion in the white house. no longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. no longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as americans. instead, we will work with you, by your side. we will work with the nra to promote responsible gun ownership, to protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful outdoors. you met my son; i can tell you, both sons, they love the outdoors. frankly, i think they love the outdoors more than they love, by a long shot, fifth avenue. but that.s okay. and we want to ensure you of the sacred right of self-defense for all of our citizens. when i spoke to this forum last year, our nation was still mourning the loss of a giant, a great defender of the constitution: justice antonin scalia. i promised that if elected, i would nominate a justice who would be faithful and loyal to the constitution. i even went one step further and publicly presented a list of 20 judges from which i would make my selection, and that.s exactly what we did. and by the way, i want to thank, really, heritage. and i want to thank also all of the people that worked with us. where.s leo? is leo around here? where is he? he.s got to be here. where is he? he has been so good. but from.“and also from heritage, jim demint. it.s been amazing. i mean, those people have been fantastic. they.ve been real friends. the federalist people, where are they? are they around here someplace? they really helped us out. i kept my promise, and now, with your help, our brandnew justice.“and he is really something very special.“neil gorsuch, sits on the bench of the united states supreme court. for the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. the last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. now, we won.t get any credit for this, but don.t worry about it; the credit is in the audience, right? the credit is in the audience. all of those people. they won.t give us credit, but it.s been a long time, and we.re very honored. we.ve also taken action to stand up for america.s sportsmen. on their very last full day in office, the previous administration issued an 11th-hour rule to restrict the use of lead ammunition on certain federal lands. have you heard about that, folks? i.m shocked to hear that. you.ve all heard about that. huh? you.ve heard about that. on his first day as secretary of the interior, ryan zinke eliminated the previous administration.s ammunition ban. he.s going to be great. ryan is going to be great. we.ve also moved very quickly to restore something gun owners care about very, very much. it.s called the rule of law. we have made clear that our administration will always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. in fact, countless members of law enforcement are also members of the nra, because our police know that responsible gun ownership saves lives and that the right of self-defense is essential to public safety. do we all agree with that? our police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed. for too long, washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals, drug dealers, traffickers, and gang members. ms-13.“you know about ms-13? it.s not pleasant for them anymore, folks. it.s not pleasant for them anymore. that.s a bad group. not pleasant for ms-13. get them the hell out of here, right? get them out. we are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding americans, and we are going after the criminal gangs and cartels that prey on our innocent citizens. and we are really going after them. as members of the nra know well, some of the most important decisions a president can make are appointments, and i.ve appointed people who believe in law, order, and justice. that is why i have selected as your attorney general, number one, a really fine person, a really good man, a man who has spent his entire career fighting crime, supporting the police, and defending the second amendment. for the first time in a long time, you now have a pro-second amendment, tough-on-crime attorney general, and his name is jeff sessions. and attorney general sessions is putting our priorities into action. he.s going after the drug dealers who are peddling their poison all over our streets and destroying our youth. he.s going after the gang members who threaten our children. and he.s fully enforcing our immigration laws in all 50 states. and you know what? it.s about time. heading up the effort to secure america.s borders is a great military general, a man of action: homeland security director [secretary]* john kelly. secretary kelly, who used to be general kelly, is following through on my pledge to protect the borders, remove criminal aliens, and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. we.ve already seen.“listen to this; it.s never happened before, people can.t even believe it. and by the way, we will build the wall no matter how low this number gets or how high this goes. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. you know, they.re trying to use this number against us because we.ve done so unbelievably at the borders already. they.re trying to use it against us. but you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people. you need the wall. but listen to this: we.ve already seen a 73 percent decrease.“never happened before.“in illegal immigration on the southern border since my election.“73 percent. you see what they.re doing, right? so why do you need a wall? we need a wall. audience member. build the wall! the president. we.ll build the wall. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. that.s an easy one. we.re going to build the wall. we need the wall. i said to general kelly, how important is it? he said, very important. it.s that final element. we need the wall. and it.s a wall in certain areas. you, obviously.“where you have these massive physical structures, you don.t need, and where you have certain big rivers and all. but we need a wall, and we.re going to get that wall. and the world is getting the message. they know that our border is no longer open to illegal immigration and that if you try to break in, you.ll be caught, and you.ll be returned to your home. you.re not staying any longer. and if you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted, and you will put behind bars. otherwise, it will never end. let.s also remember that immigration security is national security. we.ve seen the attacks from 9/11 to boston to san bernardino. hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the united states. we spend billions and billions of dollars on security all over the world, but then we allow radical islamic terrorists to enter right through our front door. that.s not going to happen anymore. it.s time to get tough. it.s time we finally got smart. and yes, it.s also time to put america first. and perhaps.“i see all of those beautiful red and white hats-.“but we will never forget our favorite slogan of them all: make america great again. all right? keeping our communities safe and protecting our freedoms also requires the cooperation of our state leaders. we have some incredible pro-second amendment governors here at the nra conference, including governor scott of florida. where is governor scott? where is he? great guy, doing a great job. governor bryant of mississippi. what a wonderful place. governor bryant is here. thank you. governor deal of georgia. and we.re also joined by two people that.“well, one i loved right from the beginning; the other one i really liked, didn.t like, and now like a lot again. [laughter] does that make sense? senator david perdue.“he was from the beginning.“and senator ted cruz.“like, dislike, like. where are they? good guys. good guys. smart cookies. each of these leaders knows that public officials must serve under the constitution, not above it. we all took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states, and that means defending the second amendment. so let me make a simple promise to every one of the freedom-loving americans in the audience today: as your president, i will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. never ever. freedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from god. it was this conviction that stirred the heart of a great american patriot on that day, april, 242 years ago. it was the day that paul revere spread his lexington alarm, the famous warning that .the british are coming, the british are coming.. right? you.ve all heard that, right? the british are coming. now we have other people trying to come, but believe me, they.re not going to be successful. that i can tell you. nothing changes, right, folks? nothing changes. they are not going to be successful. there will be serious hurt on them, not on us. next, came the shot heard around the world and then a ragtag army of god-fearing farmers, frontiersmen, shopkeepers, merchants that stood up to the most powerful army at that time on earth. the most powerful army on earth. but we sometimes forget what inspired those everyday farmers and workers in that great war for independence. many years after the war, a young man asked captain levi preston, aged 91, why he fought alongside his neighbors at concord. was it the stamp act? was it the tea tax? was it a work of philosophy? .no,. the old veteran replied. .then why?. he was asked. .young man,. the captain said, .what we meant in going for those redcoats was this: we always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to. govern ourselves. captain preston.s words are a reminder of what this organization and my administration are all about: the right of a sovereign people to govern their own affairs and govern them properly. we don.t want any longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in washington or in any other country, for that matter. in america, we are ruled by our citizens. we are ruled by each and every one of you. but we can.t be complacent. these are dangerous times. these are horrible times for certain obvious reasons. but we.re going to make them great times again. every day, we are up against those who would take away our freedoms, restrict our liberties, and even those who want to abolish the second amendment. we must be vigilant. and i know you are all up to the task. since the first generation of americans stood strong at concord, each generation to follow has answered the call to defend freedom in their time. that is why we are here today: to defend freedom for our children. to defend the liberty of all americans. and to defend the right of a free and sovereign people to keep and bear arms. i greatly appreciated your support on november 8, in what will, hopefully, be one of the most important and positive elections for the united states of all time. and to the nra, i can proudly say i will never, ever let you down. thank you. god bless you. god bless our constitution, and god bless america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you."
