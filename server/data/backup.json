   "text": "Thank you very much. You just want massive tax cuts. That \u0019s what you want. That \u0019s the only reason you \u0019re going so wild. (Applause.) But it \u0019s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana. What a place. (Applause.) I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative  Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. (Applause.) I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well. We appreciate it. (Applause.) Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane. I mean, their island was virtually destroyed. Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly. I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms. We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done. It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico. (Applause.) And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis. It \u0019s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that. And I \u0019m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected. And many of their policemen  \u0014 in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it \u0019s been a tough go. But we are  \u0014 we \u0019re going to get it back. Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county \u0019s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare. We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy. But with the rules of reconciliation, we \u0019re up against a deadline of Friday  \u0014 two days. That \u0019s just two days. And yes-vote senator  \u0014 we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator  \u0014 who is a yes vote, but he \u0019s home recovering from a pretty tough situation. And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent. It \u0019s going to be better managed for the people that it serves. Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C. Not even a contest. (Applause.) And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly. But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote. So we \u0019re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I \u0019d come in and sign. But it didn \u0019t work that way. There were a couple of people that  \u0014 I won \u0019t say anything. (Laughter.) But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we \u0019re going to have a vote. And we \u0019re going to be able to get that through, and I think we \u0019ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier. But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve. By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won \u0019t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one. And most of you know exactly what I \u0019m talking about. We \u0019re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People. (Applause.) This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it \u0019s probably something I can say that I \u0019m very good at. I \u0019ve been waiting for this for a long time. We \u0019re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country  \u0014 and most people thought left our country for good. (Applause.) We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American. (Applause.) It \u0019s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers. (Applause.) Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens. This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation  \u0014 and are we cutting regulation? (Applause.) And businesses all across the country have taken notice. In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states. Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed  \u0014 meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana. All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again. They chose, and their choice was so important. It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of  \u0014 (laughter)  \u0014 who signed the largest income tax cut in the state \u0019s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence. (Applause.) It \u0019s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana. We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them. That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office. That is what I talked about on the campaign trail. Already, we \u0019re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first. (Applause.) Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It \u0019s really a fantastic thing to see. (Applause.) Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs. GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time. (Applause.) And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact. But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better. Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country. (Applause.) America is back on the right track. And I see so many red hats  \u0014 Make America Great Again. That \u0019s what we \u0019re doing  \u0014 Make America Great Again. (Applause.) But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America \u0019s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code. It \u0019s a relic. We \u0019ve got to change it. We have to compete  \u0014 compete with other countries. The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America \u0019s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it \u0019s ever been. But we \u0019re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally  \u0014 and want and deserve. For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform. Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families  \u0014 for the working man and woman  \u0014 and for businesses of all sizes. I look forward  \u0014 (Applause.) Thank you. I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people. These tax cuts are significant. There \u0019s never been tax cuts like what we \u0019re talking about. Our framework is based on four key ideas: First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans  \u0014 the people that work so long, so hard, and they \u0019ve been forgotten. But they \u0019re not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th. (Applause.) Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and a married couple won \u0019t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income. So, a married couple  \u0014 up to $24,000  \u0014 can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do. So much better. In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero. (Applause.) At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today. Where are they? Oh, hello, Jonathan. How are you? (Applause.) Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company. Together they \u0019re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000. Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more. And that \u0019s just on federal taxes. So they would have saved at least $1,000. Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for. (Applause.) We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families. Greatly expanded. We \u0019re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children. (Applause.) And this is just one more critical way that we \u0019re targeting relief to working families. In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved  \u0014 and we love these people, but we \u0019re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents  \u0014 will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit. (Applause.) We \u0019re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family. By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners. (Applause.) Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected. They can call me all they want. It \u0019s not going to help. I \u0019m doing the right thing, and it \u0019s not good for me. Believe me. (Applause.) But what is good for me  \u0014 not only as President and legacy  \u0014 what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years. That \u0019s good for me. That \u0019s good for everyone. (Applause.) And that \u0019s what I think is going to happen. (Applause.) And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me. In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. We \u0019ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people. Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally. (Applause.) Americans waste money. Americans waste so much money  \u0014 billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code. More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper. (Applause.) We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. About time. (Applause.) The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts. You \u0019re all familiar with it. Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with. We are making our taxes simple again. We are simplifying our tax system. To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax. (Applause.) That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you \u0019ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won \u0019t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax  \u0014 lose the business, ends up going out of business. All of those jobs are lost. The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can \u0019t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. The people that buy it don \u0019t run it with love. They can \u0019t run it the same way, and it goes out. So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers. And we \u0019re getting rid of it. (Applause.) Now if you don \u0019t like your family, it won \u0019t matter, okay? (Laughter.) But for those that love your family, it matters a lot. (Laughter.) With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg  \u0014 Where \u0019s Kip? Go ahead, Kip. Hi, Kip  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 who fears that his family \u0019s farming heritage  \u0014 it \u0019s been a long time. How long, Kip? A hundred and eighty-seven years  \u0014 that \u0019s peanuts, Kip. (Applause.) Wow. That \u0019s a long time. But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family. We \u0019re not going to let that happen. We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today. (Applause.) We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans. Okay? (Applause.) Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. (Applause.) In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers. Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations. And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways. They say they \u0019re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals. (Applause.) And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines  \u0014 Dakota Access. You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved. So we \u0019re letting that happen. But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more. And it was a beautiful sight to behold. Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did. And I shouldn \u0019t say even better because we didn \u0019t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out. And we \u0019re stopping that, and you see it right here what we \u0019ve done. Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world. That \u0019s not good. We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we \u0019re not surrendering anymore. We \u0019re not surrendering anymore. Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again. (Applause.) We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent. That \u0019s way down from 35 and 39  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations. This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven \u0019t seen in many years. (Applause.) When our companies move to other countries, it \u0019s our loyal American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it \u0019s our wonderful workers who reap the rewards. And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they \u0019re going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States  \u0014 between increasing and new  \u0014 five. (Applause.) You \u0019ll be hearing about that very soon. And I said thank you very much, and he said,  \u001cyou know what? It \u0019s starting to happen in the United States. It \u0019s starting to happen. \u001d So I just wanted to let you know that. I promised I wouldn \u0019t say who. I \u0019ll keep my word. Okay? (Laughter.) Unless you force me. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Who? THE PRESIDENT: Members of both parties  \u0014 it happens to be in the automobile industry. That \u0019s a good industry. (Laughter.) Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country. (Applause.) And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent  \u0014 much lower. Big difference. (Applause.) This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years. (Applause.) To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off  \u0014 listen to this  \u0014 the cost of equipment in the year they buy it. That is big. (Applause.) And that \u0019s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time. Now that \u0019s called incentive. That \u0019s called incentive. (Applause.) This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong. Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis. John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations, John. (Applause.) And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I \u0019m just thinking  \u0014 I have to mention this  \u0014 you know, we have a fence around the White House. (Laughter.) We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence. And I figured, you know  \u0014 I \u0019m pretty good at construction  \u0014 I figured, I don \u0019t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half. And this has been taking place over a long period of time  \u0014 previous administrations. So I said,  \u001chow much is the fence you \u0019re talking around the White House? \u001d  \u001cSir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million. \u001d I said,  \u001cWhat? \u001d (Laughter.) I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that. Thousands. We \u0019re going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million. Now, I assume it \u0019s a strong fence. (Laughter.) Okay? So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million? I think he could take $49 off right now and he \u0019d have plenty of profit. Right? Right, John? It \u0019s crazy. Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology. Where \u0019s Aaron? Hello, Aaron. Hi. (Applause.) It \u0019s a good field. Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high  \u0014 and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas. You \u0019ve been watching it, Aaron. Right? All over. Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States. We \u0019re going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America. You \u0019re going to be in a much different position. Okay? (Applause.) Thank you. Tremendous incentives. We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Right? (Applause.) Made in the USA. Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that \u0019s parked overseas. Our current tax system  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 trillions. And by the way, for years I \u0019ve been hearing it \u0019s 2.5 trillion. So I \u0019ve been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it \u0019s much more. Right? But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it. For years  \u0014 who doesn \u0019t want to do it? They want to bring  \u0014 but they can \u0019t do it because it \u0019s so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous. So they can \u0019t do it. So the money stays in other countries, and it \u0019s invested in other countries. We want to bring it back. But think of it, it \u0019s one of the few things  \u0014 Democrats want it and Republicans want it. So they both want it, and yet for years they haven \u0019t been able to do it. Now we \u0019re doing it. We \u0019re doing things. (Applause.) You know, it \u0019s one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there \u0019s a dispute. But here \u0019s something everybody wants and they can \u0019t do it. So you can tell you, there \u0019s a broken system in D.C., but we \u0019re getting it fixed rather  \u0014 I think  \u0014 rather rapidly. You \u0019ll be seeing that over the next few months. Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country. We \u0019re punishing them for bringing the money back in. As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether. And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas  \u0014 so much, it \u0019s an incredible amount  \u0014 that they move the company to get their money. We \u0019re going to let them bring the money back home. (Applause.) Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We \u0019re punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States. We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work. (Applause.) The framework I \u0019ve just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America \u0019s competitive edge. Finally. (Applause.) And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews. And if Senator Donnelly doesn \u0019t approve it, because you know he \u0019s on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn \u0019t believe. (Applause.) I think they \u0019re going to approve it. I think we \u0019ll have  \u0014 actually, I think we \u0019ll have numerous Democrats come across because it \u0019s the right thing to do. These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates. It \u0019s what we can \u0019t do. Our competitors have much lower tax rates. But no longer. My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model. It \u0019s called  \u0014 the American model. (Applause.) Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. That \u0019s what we want. We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana. Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they \u0019re incentivized to leave. But now they \u0019re going to be incentivized to stay. And if that doesn \u0019t work, then we \u0019ll get even tougher than that. Okay? We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. (Applause.) That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family. We want it to happen here. (Applause.) Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today. I really believe we \u0019re going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it \u0019s the right thing to do. I believe that it \u0019s the right thing to do, and I know many of them. And they \u0019re telling me it is the right thing to do. President Reagan \u0019s tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker  \u0014 Tip O \u0019Neill. Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment. As President Kennedy very wisely said,  \u001cThe single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time \u001d  \u0014 at the right time, this is the right time  \u0014  \u001cis the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward. \u001d That was President Kennedy. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle  \u0014 it \u0019s called a middle-class miracle, once again. It \u0019s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person. I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country. (Applause.) But they \u0019ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard. Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first. And that \u0019s what we \u0019re doing. (Applause.) History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people. That is why today I am asking all Americans  \u0014 Republican, Democrat, independent  \u0014 to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again. (Applause.) Call your congressmen. Call your senators. Let them know you \u0019re watching. Let them know you \u0019re waiting. Tell them that today is the day for decision. That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound. And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us. If you demand it, the politicians will listen. They will answer, and they will act. And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride. (Applause.) With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"

And all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag  \u0014 believe me, we appreciate it very much. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. Where is Jerry? Where is Jerry? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. What a job. I \u0019ve heard so much about you. It \u0019s a great honor to know you, Jerry. Thank you. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. (Applause.) Thank you, Steve. Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. (Applause.) Small Business Administrator  \u0014 which, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell you that  \u0014 Linda McMahon, a friend of mine. (Applause.) And from the purely political world, a really great friend who did such an incredible job with his beautiful wife at the inauguration, Senator Roy Blunt. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Where \u0019s Roy? Thank you, Roy. Governor Greitens is here, who is doing some job. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Special. Lieutenant Governor Parson. Lieutenant Governor, thank you, Lieutenant Governor. And our great members of Commerce [Congress], I want to thank you all for coming. There are so many. I was asking the Governor and Roy, I said, do you think I should announce them all? I have so many. But I \u0019m honored that they \u0019re here. Representative Sam Graves. (Applause.) Representative Vicky Hartzler, who has been terrific. (Applause.) My friend for a long time, and just somebody that he liked me from the beginning and I liked him, Billy Long. Where \u0019s Billy? (Applause.) Billy. Right, Billy? Right from the beginning. Blaine Luetkemeyer  \u0014 where \u0019s Blaine? Good. Thank you, Blaine. (Applause.) Representative Jason Smith. (Applause.) Jason, thank you for everything, Jason. Representative Ann Wagner. Hi, Ann. Good job, Ann. (Applause.) And, I don \u0019t know, we have so many more. Anybody I forgot? Right? Everything okay? Good, I got it. You, I remember more than anybody. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. And to the congressmen and congresswomen, we very much appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Before we begin, I \u0019d like to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. As we all know, our Gulf Coast was hit over the weekend with a devastating hurricane of historic proportion. Torrential rains and terrible flooding continue to pose a grave danger to life and to property. Our first responders have been doing absolutely heroic work to shepherd people out of harm \u0019s way, and their courage and devotion has saved countless lives. They represent truly the very best of America. (Applause.) We must be vigilant. We must protect the lives of our people. I was on the ground in Texas yesterday to meet with Governor Abbott  \u0014 who is doing, by the way, and incredible job  \u0014 and local officials so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We see friend helping friend, neighbor helping neighbor, and stranger helping stranger. And together, we will endure and we will overcome. (Applause.) To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are here with you every single step of the way. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room  \u0014 every step of the way. (Applause.) To those Americans who have lost loved ones: All of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever. The citizens of Texas and the Gulf Coast need all the prayers, support, and resources our communities have to offer. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild. As our thoughts and prayers remain firmly with the citizens and our fellow people  \u0014 people  \u0014 great, great people  \u0014 all affected by this tragedy. We \u0019re also glad to be back in the heartland with the very, very fine folks of Missouri. (Applause.) And I said to Senator Blunt and I said to Billy Long on the plane coming in  \u0014 can I say  \u001cMissouri, \u001d or should I say  \u001cMissouruh \u001d? Okay? And they said, whatever you want is okay. So I said, good. But I \u0019m especially pleased to be here in Springfield, the birthplace of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Who would have known that? (Applause.) This is the place where the  \u001cMain Street of America \u001d got its start, and this is where America \u0019s main street will begin its big, beautiful comeback that  \u0014 you are seeing it right now. This is a comeback of historic proportions. You \u0019re seeing it happen right now. (Applause.) Right? You \u0019re seeing it. We \u0019re here today to launch our plans to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers. (Applause.) Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. And you have seen what \u0019s happening with regulations  \u0014 they \u0019re going fast. We need regulations, but many of them are unnecessary, and they \u0019re going fast. (Applause.) That is why the foundation of our job creation agenda is to fundamentally reform our tax code for the first time in more than 30 years. I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker  \u0014 and pro-American. (Applause.) There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. (Applause.) And, by the way, before I start, Ivanka Trump  \u0014 I see my beautiful daughter is in the audience. Stand up, honey. (Applause.) She \u0019s working very hard. I \u0019m very proud of Ivanka. For many decades, Route 66 captured the American spirit. The communities along this historic route were a vivid symbol of America \u0019s booming industry. Truck drivers hauled made-in-America goods along this vital artery of commerce. Families passed through bustling towns on their way to explore the great American West. And high-quality manufacturing jobs lifted up communities, gave Americans a paycheck that could support a family. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that do it. (Applause.) Stand up. Stand up Mr. Cook. Stand up. (Applause.) I think they like you. And provided millions of our fellow citizens with the pride and dignity that comes with work. But, in recent years, millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And it wasn \u0019t pleasant to watch, especially for me. I would sit back  \u0014 I was in business  \u0014 and I could see what was happening. It wasn \u0019t good. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. (Applause.) In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around two percent a year. If you look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they \u0019re unhappy when it \u0019s seven, eight, nine. And I speak to them  \u0014 leaders of the countries  \u0014 how are you doing?  \u001cNot well, not well. \u001d Why?  \u001cGDP is down to seven percent. \u001d And I \u0019m saying, we were hitting one percent just a number of months ago. So we \u0019re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you. And we \u0019re going change it around fast. (Applause.) And today  \u0014 a very appropriate day that this should happen  \u0014 we just announced that we hit three percent in GDP. It just came out. (Applause.) And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit three percent. So we \u0019re really on our way. If we achieve sustained three percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade. That \u0019s some numbers. (Applause.) And I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. There \u0019s no reason why we shouldn \u0019t. (Applause.) So this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. And I don \u0019t want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me? Do you understand? (Applause.) Congress  \u0014 I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so. (Laughter.) I tell you what, the United States is counting on it. (Applause.) Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. (Applause.) That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests. Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax breaks, reduced the number of tax brackets from fifteen to two, and lowered tax rates for both individuals and businesses. At the time, it was really something special. Since then, our tax laws have tripled in size, and the tax code itself now spans more than 2,600 pages, and most of it is not understandable. Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. The tax code is now a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans. In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instructions. Today, that basic form has one hundred pages of instructions, and it \u0019s pretty complex stuff. The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes. This enormous complexity is very unfair. It disadvantages ordinary Americans who don \u0019t have an army of accountants while benefitting deep-pocketed special interests. And most importantly, this is wrong. (Applause.) Thank you. First and foremost, our tax system should benefit loyal, hardworking Americans and their families. (Applause.) That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes  \u0014 and I \u0019m speaking against myself when I do this, I have to tell you. And I might be speaking against Mr. Cook, and we \u0019re both okay with it, is that right? It \u0019s crazy. We \u0019re speaking  \u0014 maybe we shouldn \u0019t be doing this, you know? (Laughter.) But we \u0019re doing the right thing. (Applause.) True. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant. Second, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It \u0019s time to give American workers the pay raise that they \u0019ve been looking for for many, many years. (Applause.) In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34 percent. That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time. Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened. But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully  \u0014 right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family income increased. Other countries saw the success. They looked at us. They saw  \u0014 what is America doing? What \u0019s happening with the United States? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. Over the past 30 years, the average business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, China and some others that are highly competitive, and really doing very well against us. They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners. So we must  \u0014 we have no choice  \u0014 we must lower our taxes. And your Senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. And if she doesn \u0019t do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office. (Applause.) She \u0019s got to make that commitment. She \u0019s got to make that commitment. If she doesn \u0019t do it, you just can \u0019t do this anymore, with the obstruction and the obstructionists. If we don \u0019t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever  \u0014 we are looking for the biggest ever  \u0014 jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. But, at a minimum, they won \u0019t take off the way they should. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Not one vote. We got not one vote to try and fix healthcare and get rid of Obamacare. The strategy of our economic rivals has worked. They made their taxes lower  \u0014 and far lower, in many cases, than ours  \u0014 and jobs left our country. Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, where they \u0019d make massive profits, and they wouldn \u0019t be paying tax to us either. So we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We got nothing but unemployment. We got nothing. Other businesses  \u0014 even classic American brands  \u0014 switched their headquarters to foreign countries. Because of this and other reasons, like weak borders, America remains stuck in the past. Although I have to tell you, we have General Kelly here today, and we stopped 78 percent  \u0014 going up to 80 percent  \u0014 on the border traffic coming through, in just a short period of time. (Applause.) He has done some job. A whole different world out there right now. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent, and it \u0019s way more than that. And think of it: In some cases, way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes, in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and many other nations. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive trade deficits  \u0014 numbers that you would not believe. But this administration is going to fix that. One by one, we \u0019re fixing it. We \u0019re working right now on NAFTA  \u0014 the horrible, terrible NAFTA deal that took so much business out of your state and out of your cities and towns, and we \u0019re working on it. Let \u0019s see what happens. (Applause.) Mexico is not happy. (Laughter.) But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone. We got to change this deal. And hopefully we can renegotiate it. But if we can \u0019t, we \u0019ll terminate it and we \u0019ll start all over again with a real deal. (Applause.) So when it comes to the business tax, we are dead last. Can you believe that? So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind. We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors, to one that is more than 60 percent higher. We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. We have totally surrendered. We \u0019re not surrendering anymore. (Applause.) Ideally  \u0014 and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury  \u0014 we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world. But it would make us highly competitive. In other words, foreign companies have more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. They can pay their workers more, sell their products and services at lower cost, and still make more money than their U.S. competitors. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America  \u0014 the America we love. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Because when businesses compete for labor, your wages will go up. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the USA. (Applause.) When I was growing up, I always used to see the signs, and it was always stamped on the product: Made in the USA. You don \u0019t see it anymore. We \u0019re going to go back to Made in the USA  \u0014 Made in the USA. \u001d (Applause.) The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families. (Applause.) In a way  \u0014 and I \u0019ve been saying this for a long time  \u0014 they \u0019ve been sort of the forgotten people, but they \u0019re not forgotten any longer. I can tell you that. (Applause.) We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and they can do lots of things with those paychecks. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but that means they \u0019ll go out, and they \u0019ll spend their money. And it will be a beautiful thing to watch. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of raising a family. That \u0019s so important to Ivanka Trump. (Applause.) Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter. It \u0019s one of her real big beliefs. And she \u0019s very committed to that. Right, Ivanka? We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money, and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it. (Applause.) So they \u0019ll keep their money. They \u0019ll spend their money. They \u0019ll buy our product. Our factories will be moving again. Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat  \u0014 it says: Make America Great Again. That \u0019s what we \u0019re going to do. (Applause.) Right? Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that \u0019s parked overseas. Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there. The amount of money we \u0019re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that? By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money, and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult, we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. It \u0019s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our communities, and to hire our great American workers. (Applause.) My administration is embracing a new economic model. It \u0019s called very simply: The American Model. Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. That is how we will all succeed and grow together, as one team, with one shared sense of purpose, and one glorious American destiny. (Applause.) So today I \u0019m calling on all members of Congress  \u0014 Democrat, Republican and independent  \u0014 to support pro-American tax reform. They have to do it. It \u0019s time. (Applause.) They have to do it. It is time. I \u0019m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for our workers and our companies, to attract new companies and businesses to our shores, and to put more money into the pockets of everyday, hardworking people and also into the pockets of our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. (Applause.) What could possibly be more bipartisan than allowing families to keep more of what they earn and creating an environment for real job and wage growth in the country that we love so much? (Applause.) So let \u0019s put  \u0014 or at least try to put  \u0014 the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. (Applause.) If we do this, if we unite in the name of common sense and the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and we will give America the competitive advantage that it so desperately needs and has been looking for for so long. It \u0019s time. (Applause.) Products made with American hands, American labor, and American grit will once again be delivered throughout the world. It \u0019s true. (Applause.) It \u0019s time. Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods. (Applause.) Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America. We \u0019ll have it both ways. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work. They will love getting up in the morning. They will love going to their job. They will love earning a big, fat, beautiful paycheck. They will be proud again. (Applause.) That is the future I want for our people. That is the future I want for America  \u0014 a nation where we are proud, prosperous, united, and free. Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things  \u0014 beautiful things  \u0014 for our country. I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have many with us today, to join me in unleashing America \u0019s full potential. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our people. And if we do these things, and if we care for and support each other, and love each other, then we will truly make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Governor, thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Thank you, everybody."

   "speechlocation": "Congress",
   "text": "Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation \u0019s path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. (Applause.) Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week \u0019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. (Applause.) Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. (Applause.) All the nations of the world  \u0014 friend or foe  \u0014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding  \u0014 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we \u0019ve watched our middle class shrink as we \u0019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We \u0019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land. We \u0019ve defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we \u0019ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds  \u0014 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again. (Applause.) Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. (Applause.) It \u0019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I \u0019ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. (Applause.) The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We \u0019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic  \u0014 and it is a fantastic  \u0014 new F-35 jet fighter, and we \u0019ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 thank you  \u0014 and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency. (Applause.) And we \u0019re imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. (Applause.) We \u0019re going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. (Applause.) We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. And I \u0019ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. (Applause.) We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. (Applause.) To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. (Applause.) We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. (Applause.) At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. (Applause.) By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. (Applause.) We want all Americans to succeed, but that can \u0019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders. (Applause.) For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. (Applause.) As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? (Applause.) Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home  \u0014 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. (Applause.) Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. (Applause.) That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm. (Applause.) As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  \u0014 a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. (Applause.) I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran \u0019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. (Applause.) Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution. (Applause.) I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. (Applause.) Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. (Applause.) Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined. We \u0019ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we \u0019ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy  \u0014 making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country. (Applause.) Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. (Applause.) It will be a big, big cut. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers. We have to do it. (Applause.) Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. ((Laughter and applause.) And they wanted me to ride one and I said,  \u001cNo, thank you. \u001d (Laughter.) At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it \u0019s good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales? They told me  \u0014 without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they \u0019ve become used to it  \u0014 that it \u0019s very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren \u0019t even asking for a change. But I am. (Applause.) I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade. It \u0019s been a long time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the  \u001cabandonment of the protective policy by the American government & will produce want and ruin among our people. \u001d Lincoln was right  \u0014 and it \u0019s time we heeded his advice and his words. (Applause.) I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer. (Applause.) I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. (Applause.) The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system. (Applause.) It \u0019s a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America \u0019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers \u0019 wages, and help struggling families  \u0014 including immigrant families  \u0014 enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed. (Applause.) I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation \u0019s security; and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. (Applause.) Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program  \u0014 the building of the Interstate Highway System. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. (Applause.) America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in theMiddle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country  \u0013 twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States  \u0014 financed through both public and private capital  \u0014 creating millions of new jobs. (Applause.) This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy American and hire American. (Applause.) Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare. (Applause.) Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country. (Applause.) The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do. (Applause.) Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State  \u0014 it is unsustainable and collapsing. One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all. There \u0019s no choice left. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. (Applause.) Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. (Applause.) Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. (Applause.) Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts  \u0014 but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government. (Applause.) Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. (Applause.) Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately. (Applause.) And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more  \u0014 so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right? (Applause.) On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people. (Applause.) My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave, to invest in women \u0019s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. (Applause.) Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past five. On receiving this news, Megan \u0019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan \u0019s life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame. (Applause.) Megan \u0019s story is about the unbounded power of a father \u0019s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan \u0019s life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan. (Applause.) In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. (Applause.) I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children. (Applause.) These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them. (Applause.) Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning  \u0014 a great learning center  \u0014 with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her master \u0019s degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. (Applause.) But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. (Applause.) Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. (Applause.) But to create this future, we must work with, not against  \u0014 not against  \u0014 the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  \u0014 not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it \u0019s what it is, division. It \u0019s pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They \u0019re friends and neighbors, they \u0019re mothers and fathers, sons and daughters  \u0014 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they \u0019ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE  \u0014 Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests. (Applause.) Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel \u0019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. (Applause.) To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory. (Applause.) Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war  \u0014 if they must  \u0014 they have to fight and they only have to win. (Applause.) I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them. (Applause.) The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. (Applause.) We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William  \u001cRyan \u001d Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. (Applause.) I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that  \u0014 and I quote  \u0014  \u001cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. \u001d Ryan \u0019s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. (Applause.) And Ryan is looking down, right now  \u0014 you know that  \u0014 and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record. (Laughter and applause.) For as the Bible teaches us,  \u001cThere is no greater act of love than to lay down one \u0019s life for one \u0019s friends. \u001d Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan. (Applause.) To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism. (Applause.) But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. (Applause.) We expect our partners  \u0014 whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific  \u0014 to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that. We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. (Applause.) Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. (Applause.) But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world  \u0014 all across the world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding. (Applause.) America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America \u0019s centennial. At that celebration, the country \u0019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America \u0019s 250th year. (Applause.) Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask. (Applause.) When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before  \u0014 for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are made by the same God. (Applause.) When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States. (Applause.)"

   "speechtitle": "President Trump on the Paris Climate Accord",
   "speechdate": "June 2017",
   "speechlocation": "The White House",
   "text": "Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We \u0019re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what \u0019s going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I \u0019d like to begin with an update on our tremendous  \u0014 absolutely tremendous  \u0014 economic progress since Election Day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We \u0019ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs. I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We \u0019re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up  \u0014 and you see that, you see it all over  \u0014 from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren \u0019t doing so much in the form of contribution. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President  \u0013- whether it \u0019s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we \u0019ve just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so. On these issues and so many more, we \u0019re following through on our commitments. And I don \u0019t want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 thank you, thank you  \u0014 but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we \u0019re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that \u0019s fair. And if we can, that \u0019s great. And if we can \u0019t, that \u0019s fine. (Applause.) As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers  \u0014 who I love  \u0014 and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs  \u0014 not what we need  \u0014 believe me, this is not what we need  \u0014 including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little. According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal  \u0014 and I happen to love the coal miners  \u0014 down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that. Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States  \u0014 which is what it does - \u0013 the world \u0019s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world \u0019s leading polluters. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years  \u0014 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America  \u0014 which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We \u0019re having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It \u0019s unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn \u0019t happened. They asked me if I \u0019d go. I \u0019m going to try. China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can \u0019t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We \u0019re supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants. In short, the agreement doesn \u0019t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement  \u0014 they went wild; they were so happy  \u0014 for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world. We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America \u0019s poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation  \u0014 it \u0019s great wealth, it \u0019s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth  \u0014 and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree  \u0014 think of that; this much  \u0014 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America  \u0014 and this is an incredible statistic  \u0014 would totally wipe out the gains from America \u0019s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes. As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning:  \u001cThe reality is that withdrawing is in America \u0019s economic interest and won \u0019t matter much to the climate. \u001d The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We \u0019ll be the cleanest. We \u0019re going to have the cleanest air. We \u0019re going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we \u0019re not going to put our businesses out of work and we \u0019re not going to lose our jobs. We \u0019re going to grow; we \u0019re going to grow rapidly. (Applause.) And I think you just read  \u0014 it just came out minutes ago, the small business report  \u0014 small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they \u0019ve seen in many years. I \u0019m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. (Applause.) So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let \u0019s make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we \u0019ll make it good, and we won \u0019t be closing up our factories, and we won \u0019t be losing our jobs. And we \u0019ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that \u0019s much better than the Paris Accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we \u0019re out of the agreement. I will work to ensure that America remains the world \u0019s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world. No responsible leader can put the workers  \u0014 and the people  \u0014 of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world \u0019s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It \u0019s to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That \u0019s not going to happen while I \u0019m President. I \u0019m sorry. (Applause.) My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection. Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it \u0019s doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We \u0019d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it \u0019s going very well. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country \u0019s expense. They don \u0019t put America first. I do, and I always will. (Applause.) The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what \u0019s happening. It \u0019s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don \u0019t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won \u0019t be. They won \u0019t be. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Applause.) I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America \u0019s interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they \u0019ll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we \u0019re down to business. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund  \u0014 nice name  \u0014 which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America \u0019s existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we \u0019re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we \u0019re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven \u0019t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion  \u0014 nobody else is even close; most of them haven \u0019t even paid anything  \u0014 including funds raided out of America \u0019s budget for the war against terrorism. That \u0019s where they came. Believe me, they didn \u0019t come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money. In 2015, the United Nation \u0019s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as  \u001cpeanuts, \u001d and stated that  \u001cthe $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog. \u001d In 2015, the Green Climate Fund \u0019s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to? Of course, the world \u0019s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that. There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America \u0019s sovereignty. (Applause.) Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America \u0019s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal. The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point  \u0014 as bad as it is  \u0014 not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States \u0019 sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris Accord  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  \u0014 along with many, many other locations within our great country  \u0014 before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Very important. I \u0019d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words."

   "text": "thank you very much. thank you. wow. you know, i asked how many people would be here tonight. they said a couple of hundred. it was just like a little fundraiser. they didn’t say you broke — 23 years, you broke the all-time record tonight — $30.1 million. and broke it by $10 million — that’s not so close. so, congratulations. we’re going to have a great eight years together. (applause.) and rasmussen just came out with a very good poll — you’ll be liking this poll. this poll is good. we’re going to do a good job. more importantly, we’re going to do a great job, and then we’re going to win it the old-fashioned way — we’re just going to win it. and i want to thank everybody. this is a lot more than 200 people. this is a hell of a big room. (laughter.) that’s far back. can you see over there? see, i would have gotten rid of these columns, actually. (laughter.) that’s being a construction man. but that was a long time ago, they didn’t do that. well, it’s an honor to address you tonight, and thank each and every one of you for your role in helping to build, sustain and grow a truly strong republican party again. in this effort, we will be working hand-in-hand with our house leadership team — and i’ve really gotten to know them and they are winners and they are terrific people — terrific people. (applause.) speaker paul ryan, leader kevin mccarthy, majority whip steve scalise, and conference chairwoman cathy mcmorris rodgers. what a group, great group (applause.) also with us tonight — a man who i have a lot respect for, gave me a very early endorsement — former vice president dick cheney, along with his daughter, congressman liz cheney. (applause.) where is he? thank you, dick. thank you. thank you, liz. i also want to thank the chairman of the republican congressional — i mean, look, what a group — committee. where is steve? where is he? they lost him backstage. steve stivers — where is he? steve, what the hell happened? i think he left. (laughter.) everyone is looking — it’s the second time he’s been introduced. steve, are you there? oh. come here, steve. what a job you did. come here, steve. he’s embarrassed. (laughter.) come here, come on, get up here, steve. come here. (applause.) mr. stivers: thanks, everybody. the president: that’s what i like. see, that’s a real worker. oh, boy — no talk, all action, right? we like people like that. congratulations to steve. and march dinner chairman, steve womack, and the nrcc finance chair, ann wagner — thank you. thank you, ann. (applause.) the work of the nrcc never ends. in fact, we have four special elections currently underway in georgia — we won — montana — we won — kansas — we won — and south carolina. we love south carolina. that’s some group. where’s south carolina? oh, we love south carolina. remember i was supposed to lose that one big and we won by 21 points. and that’s when i found out these polls are rigged. (laughter.) they were rigged. thank you, south carolina. i learned a lot from south carolina. our nominees from montana and kansas are here with us this evening — greg gianforte and ron estes. thank you. thank you very much. (applause.) thank you. on november 8th, the american people voted for historic change — and they also voted for serious action. by delivering the house, the senate and the white house, the american people gave us clear instructions: it’s time to get busy, get to work, and to get the job done. (applause.) that legislative effort begins with thursday’s crucial vote — and it really is a crucial vote for the republican party and for the people of our country — to finally repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare. it’s what it is, a disaster. premiums have soared double digits and even triple digits. insurance companies are fleeing. one-third of counties only have one obamacare insurer left. i was in tennessee four nights ago — they’ve lost half the state. the insurance companies are gone and they’re going to lose the next one pretty soon from what they say. and last night in kentucky, we had a tremendous crowd — 25,000 people, more — and a similar crowd in tennessee, by the way — packed, with thousands of people outside. they couldn’t get them into these massive arenas — there’s something going on that’s really incredible in this country. it’s really incredible. but kentucky also is having a tremendous problem, as you know and as you’ve read, with obamacare. and many other states. the house bill ends the obamacare nightmare and gives healthcare decisions back to the states — and back to the american people. these are the conservative solutions we campaigned on, and these are the conservative solutions the american people asked us as a group to deliver. we are keeping our promises. i go to these arenas, and they have signs all over the place — he’s kept his promise. he’s kept his promise. because i’ve done a lot of work. the border is in the best shape it’s been in in decades. down 61 percent since inauguration. (applause.) general kelly — you know, they used to put political people — i refuse to say political hacks because i would not say that. because there is no such thing as a political hack. but they would put nice political people at the border. i put general kelly — recommended by general “mad dog” mattis. (applause.) i said to him, general — general mattis — i said, general, i need somebody really smart and really tough for the border. sir, i have the man — general kelly. soon as i saw him it was like — an interview lasted for about 30 seconds — i said, he’s the right guy. and he’s been great. and general mattis has been great — you see what’s going on. big difference. it’s been 60 days since my inauguration, and that was a promise that i’ve really kept. as you saw today in the senate, i nominated a supreme court justice who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states. (applause.) i’ve taken historic action to eliminate unnecessary, job-killing regulations. and we’ve just started on that one. (applause.) but we’ve gotten rid of a lot of them. that includes eliminating regulations crushing our coal industry. we’re going to put our great coal miners back to work. clean coal. clean coal. (applause.) i’ve cleared the way for the dakota access and keystone xl pipelines — and added a requirement that american pipelines be constructed with american steel. that was the last minute. i said, where are we getting the steel? i won’t tell you where, but you can guess. i said, from now on we have to go — we have to build them here. you want to put pipelines under our land you’re going to make the pipe in this country. (applause.) and one other thing happened. i have to tell you, it’s sort of interesting. so i get a call from the ex-president of goldman sachs who now works for — gary cohn. i said to him, gary, let me ask you — i heard there was a lawsuit. i hear the pipeline company is suing us. i said, how much? $14 billion. i said, wait a minute. i’m approving the pipeline and they’re suing us for $14 billion, and i’ve already approved it, right? i said, i just heard it. go back to them and tell them if they don’t drop the suit immediately we are going to terminate the deal you have great — you know, being president gives you great power, right? (laughter.) so i just saw him this morning — i said, by the way, how did you do? he said, sir, they dropped the suit. good. (applause.) isn’t that easier — look, if i’m — do you think hillary does that? i don’t think so. i don’t think so. isn’t that easier, though, than settling for like $4 billion seven years from now? oh, but the lawyers aren’t happy at all. they don’t like it. you got a lot of lawyers in this crowd — they’re not happy about that deal. because of the new business climate that we’re creating, jobs are already starting to pour back in — companies like sprint, intel, exxon-mobile — where a great man, rex tillerson, is doing an incredible job — (applause) — ran that company for many years and ran it well. walmart, ford, fiat-chrysler and general motors have all announced that they’re keeping or adding tens of thousands of jobs right here in america. a big difference. we used to hear they’re all leaving. now they’re all coming back. they’re coming back, too, believe me. if they don’t, we’re taxing the hell out of their products, so you know they’re coming back. (applause.) why didn’t somebody start doing that 25 years ago? one company said, sir, we’re building a big plant — there’s nothing we can do to stop it. it’s already under construction. i said, here’s the story — when you make your cars, or whatever, and you fire all our american employees, and then you think in your new plant — beautiful new plant, congratulations — you’re going to sell that product our border, tax-free, you’re wrong — 35 percent tax. it’s amazing how quickly they say, you know, i think we’ve decided to stay in the united states. i only wonder, why didn’t somebody do this like 25 years ago? you would have had nobody leaving. so far, i think i’m batting about 100 percent. to save taxpayer dollars, i’ve already begun negotiating better contracts for the federal government — saving over $700 million on just one set of airplanes of which there are many sets. as i promised during the campaign, i have proposed a budget that eliminates the defense sequester and fully rebuilds the united states military. we need it more than ever. (applause.) we need it more than ever. we’ve got a lot of haters out there — they hate. we got some people running some countries that are bad people. we will take care of it. we will ensure that the america warrior — and if you think about it, the great american warriors — because that’s what they are — are given the tools, the funding, the resources, the training and equipment they so richly deserve. they are warriors, and they have old equipment. they’re not going to have old equipment much longer. and we will take care of our great veterans. what’s happening there is going to be incredible. finally, we’re going to take care of our veterans. (applause.) our defense expansion will fully pay — and this will be something that is so important — it will be fully paid by making government leaner, more accountable and just perfect for our people. but i will tell you, if it’s not fully paid — because we’re doing a big number, with the planes and the ships — our navy is at world war i levels. can you believe that? world war i levels. so if we don’t fully pay, we’re going to do a little work, but we’re going to get our military rebuilt — bigger and better and stronger than ever — because we have no choice, folks. there’s some bad players out there. (applause.) and it’s going to go quickly. i have also followed through on my promise to secure, protect and defend the borders of the united states — and, yes, we will build a great border wall at our southern border. (applause.) it will be built. these security actions will save billions of dollars, millions of jobs, and thousands and thousands of lives. we’re also taking decisive action to improve our vetting procedures. the courts are not helping us, i have to be honest with you. ridiculous. somebody said i should not criticize judges. okay, i’ll criticize judges. (laughter.) to keep criminals and terrorists the hell out of our country. we are keeping these promises, and many, many more. after we repeal and replace obamacare, our republican majority will pass massive, historic tax reform — the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan, and potentially even bigger. it’s going to be very big. (applause.) and by the way, we had to go — had no choice — had to go with the healthcare first. you know how it works. this is one room that really does know how it works. but we had to go with the healthcare first. and we’re doing well. i think we’re going to have some great surprises. i hope that it’s going to all work out. then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they’re going to be really fantastic, and i am looking forward to that one. that one is going to be fun. that one is going to be fun. that’s called the wheelhouse. we’re going to do a great job for companies. we’re going to bring back — could be $3 to $5 trillion from overseas, money that can’t be brought back as part of our taxes. (applause.) and it will lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the most competitive anywhere in the world. way, way down. (applause.) we will do everything we can to lower business burdens and to make it easier for our businesses to thrive and compete. but in exchange, they must hire, invest and grow in america. we’re not giving them anything — okay? they got to do that. that’s the one thing. we’re working with the automobile industry who have been played around with. and i’m saying, we’ll do things for you, but you got to build new plants all over the place. you got to build new plants in our country. and they’re doing it, they’re starting. it’s going to be amazing. i have called this model, the model that you’ve been watching, the model that’s created so much value, the model of bringing back jobs and bringing back industry — i called it the american model. and this is the system that our founders wanted. our greatest american leaders — including george washington, hamilton, jackson, lincoln — they all agreed that for america to be a strong nation it must also be a great manufacturing nation. have to make money. the republican platform of 1896 — more than a century ago — stated that: “protection and reciprocity are twin measures of american policy and go hand in hand.” i mean, we have situations where other countries who have zero respect for our country — by the way, do you notice they’re starting to respect us a lot? a lot. a lot. they’ll charge us 100 percent tax on some — 100 percent. and we charge them nothing. they’ll make it impossible through regulations for our product to be sold in their country, and yet they’ll sell their product routinely in our country. not going to happen anymore. the word, “reciprocity” — they do it, we do it. who can complain about that? big difference. you’re talking about big, big dollars, too, by the way. the platform went on to say: “we renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of american industrial independence and the foundation of american development and prosperity.” now, these were some of our greatest leaders, some of whom were great businesspeople. they understood we have to do it. and just so you understand, i’m a free trader, but free trade has been very unfair trade. so i now say i’m a fair trader. and i want to trade all over the world. i don’t want to have it just here. but we’re going to be beneficiaries from now on. we’re not going to be the people that are taken advantage of any longer. that’s been happening for decades and decades — not going to happen any longer. (applause.) and they know it. one country came in to see me recently — big country, good country, great person. one of his first questions, sir, how much will you be charging us? it’s like he knew. he knew. (laughter.) he knew. they’ve been ripping us for years and he finally saw somebody that understands — so it’s one of those — (laughter.) you don’t mind having a rich nation again and having lower taxes, do you? does anybody here mind? anybody mind, please stand up. i know dick cheney will not stand on this one. please stand up. as long as the gop stands for “made in the usa,” — remember in the old days, cars all said, “made in the usa,” right? we don’t have that too much anymore. we’re going to have it again soon. i’m telling all the car companies, put a big label, “made in the usa” — it’s going to stand for quality. our party will have a very, very bright future. it is fitting that we are in the national building museum. since its founding, the republican party has been a party of builders. many of the great builders are in this audience tonight. some of them i have to compete with and i really — actually, i don’t like very many of them. (laughter.) some of them i do. some of them i truly dislike a lot. (laughter.) but now i like everybody. i like all the great builders. see, now it’s different. (laughter.) now we’re all on the same side, so i like — see the guy over there? i couldn’t stand that guy for years. he did a good job, but i couldn’t stand him. now i like you. (laughter.) our first republican president, abraham lincoln, ran his first campaign for public office in 1832 — when he was only 23 years old. he began by imagining the benefits a railroad could bring to his port [part] of illinois — without ever having seen a steam-powered train. he had no idea, and yet he knew what it could be. thirty years later, as president, lincoln signed the law that built the first transcontinental railroad, uniting our country from ocean to ocean. great president. most people don’t even know he was a republican, right? does anyone know? lot of people don’t know that. we have to build that up a little bit more. let’s take an ad — let’s use one of those pacs. (laughter.) those pacs, you never know what the hell is going to come out of those pacs. (laughter.) you think they’re friendly — although the best ad i ever had was one done against me by hillary — it was so good, i said i hope she keeps running that ad. (laughter.) another great republican president, dwight eisenhower, had a vision of a national infrastructure plan. as an officer in the army after world war i, he joined a military convoy that trekked across the nation to the pacific coast. it traveled along the lincoln highway — called then the lincoln highway. its journey began by the south lawn of the white house, at a monument known today as zero milestone. anybody know where that is? the journey made a great impression on then young eisenhower. more than three decades later, as president, he signed the bill that created our great interstate highway system — once again uniting us as a nation. now is time for a new republican administration, working with our republican congress, to pass the next great infrastructure bill. (applause.) our party must dream as big and as bold as lincoln and eisenhower. together, republicans will lead america into our unbelievable future. we have so much potential. we have so much potential. i see it now even more than i saw it in this great campaign — which turned out to be a movement, a movement like the world has never seen before, actually. you know, it’s funny, i’ve said that so often, they don’t even correct me — the fake media. they never correct me, because it’s true. oh, believe me, if it’s off by 100th of a percent, it’s like i end up getting pinocchio’s, right? they don’t even correct me. one of the great movements of all time. and it’s not my movement. it’s a movement of the people. it’s been something that’s really been very special. i’m like a messenger. i’m nothing more than a messenger. (applause.) i’m a messenger. i did a good job as a messenger, but i’m a messenger. it’s been a lot of fun, too. imagine the breakthroughs that will breathe fresh life into forgotten places. picture the new roads that will carve pathways all across our land — and we need them. and think of the new inventions that will lift up the sights of our nation. finally, as we imagine this new prosperity at home, let us also work to achieve real and enduring peace abroad. (applause.) people don’t realize, i have to say, what a mess we inherited. i’m telling you, you look at north korea. you look at the middle east. you look all over. you look at the horrible, horrible, horrible iran deal. i still have not been able to figure out why anybody would have signed that deal. i asked generals — i have them in my office — i say, general, please tell me why did they sign that deal. unbelievable. but we’re going to straighten things out, folks. the best republican presidents have not only been warfighters, but also peacemakers. we will never hesitate to do what we must to keep us safe today, but we will always seek a more peaceful tomorrow. we will, and we will succeed. (applause.) if we stand for these things — safety, prosperity and peace — then there is no limit to what we can achieve: a future where millions are lifted from welfare to work. and they’re going to love it. they’re going to love it. they’re going to love waking up in the morning, going to work. communities thriving with jobs and surging with commerce. inner cities filled with new hope and new opportunity. schools where our children can learn free from violence and free from fear. and new frontiers in science, technology and space that inspire the next generation of american youth. all of this, and so much more, is possible. our country is great. a new national pride is stirring our souls. a new optimism is sweeping our land. a new era of american greatness is just beginning. somewhere in america tonight, a child is born in poverty, looking up into the sky, and filling their heart with dreams — big, beautiful, bold dreams. and if we make the right choices together, then no one will ever have to tell that child that their dreams will have to wait for another day, another year, or another decade. because the waiting now is over. the time for action is now. this is the moment when great deeds are done — and we will do those great deeds. by putting our faith in the people, and by putting our trust in god, we will rise to this occasion like no one has ever risen before. (applause.) thank you so much. thank you. great people, great country. thank you so much. we will prove worthy of this moment. anything is possible if we stand together, united and strong. not just as republicans — but as great and unified americans. join me in believing in this better and brighter future. join me in building this reality. and join me in rededicating ourselves to the common good of this nation that we all love so much. together, we will defend our freedoms. we will defend our people. and we will defend our great and beautiful american flag. (applause.) thank you. god bless you, and god bless the united states of america. thank you very much. (applause.)"

(applause.) unbelievable. so i’m thrilled to be here in nashville, tennessee, the home — (applause) — of country music, southern hospitality, and the great president andrew jackson. (applause.) i just came from a tour of andrew jackson’s home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth. jackson’s life was devoted to one very crucial principle — he understood that real leadership means putting america first. (applause.) before becoming president, andrew jackson served your state from the house of representatives and in the united states senate, and he also served as commander of the tennessee militia. tough cookie. tough cookie. (applause.) so let’s begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the united states military and all of our wonderful veterans. the veterans. (applause.) audience: usa! usa! usa! the president: amazing. there’s no place i’d rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country. (applause.) i would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly — or reporters from washington, d.c. (applause.) it’s patriotic americans like you who make this country run, and run well. you pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars.

(applause.) the forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me. (applause.) i want to thank so many of your state leaders — state party chairman scott golden; congressman scott desjarlais; congresswoman marsha blackburn; congresswoman diane black; congressman jimmy duncan — right from the beginning.

(applause.) and we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag. (applause.) it’s been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we’ve been putting our america first agenda very much into action. you see what’s happening. we’re keeping our promises. in fact, they have signs — “he’s kept his promise.” they’re all over the place. i have. (applause.) we have done far more — i think maybe more than anybody’s done in this office in 50 days, that i could tell you. (applause.) and we have just gotten started. wait until you see what’s coming, folks. we’ve appointed a supreme court justice to replace the late, great antonin scalia. his name is judge neil gorsuch. (applause.) he will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states. we are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy — and i mean bloated — while protecting our national security. you see what we’re doing with our military — bigger, better, stronger than ever before. you see what’s happening. (applause.) and you’re already seeing the results. our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country. (applause.) we believe — especially the people in tennessee, i know you people so well — (applause) — in peace through strength. that’s what we’re going to have. and we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share. they have to pay. (applause.) we’ve begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before — slash, slash. we’re going to protect the environment, we’re going to protect people’s safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we’re going to bring it down to where it should be. (applause.) audience: usa! usa! usa! the president: okay, let’s go. one person — and they’ll be the story tomorrow — did you hear there was a protestor? (applause.) we’re going to put our miners back to work. we’re going to put our auto industry back to work. already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven’t seen in many, many decades. (applause.) in the first two job reports since i took the oath of office, we’ve already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it’s just beginning. (applause.) i’ve already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed keystone and dakota access pipelines. (applause.) a lot of jobs. i’ve also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with american steel. (applause.) they want to build them here, they use our steel. we believe in two simple rules: buy american and hire american. (applause.) on trade, i’ve kept my promise to the american people, and withdrawn from the trans-pacific partnership disaster. (applause.) tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of nafta, one of the worst trade deals ever in history. our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since china joined the world trade organization — 60,000. think of that. more than that. we’re not going to let it happen anymore. from now on, we are going to defend the american worker and our great american companies. (applause.) and if america does what it says, and if your president does what i’ve been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks. not even close. (applause.) if a company wants to leave america, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences. (applause.) that’s what we have borders for. and by the way, aren’t our borders getting extremely strong? (applause.) very strong. audience: usa! usa! usa! the president: don’t even think about it. we will build the wall. don’t even think about it. (applause.) in fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid. we had hundreds of bidders. everybody wants to build our wall. (applause.) usually, that means we’re going to get a good price. we’re going to get a good price, believe me. (applause.) we’re going to build the wall. some of the fake news said, i don’t think donald trump wants to build the wall. can you imagine if i said we’re not going to build a wall? fake news. fake, fake news. fake news, folks. a lot of fake. no, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are. it’s under design, and you’re going to see some very good things happening. but the border by itself right now is doing very well. it’s becoming very strong. general kelly has done a great job — general kelly. my administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our united states. our southern border will be protected always. it will have the wall. drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon. you’re already seeing what’s going on. the drugs are pouring into our country, folks. they are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we’re going to stop it. we’re not going to playing games. not going to be playing games. (applause.) following my executive action — and don’t forget, we’ve only been here for like — what? — 50 days — we’ve already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; 61 percent since inauguration day — 61 percent. think about it. and now people are saying, we’re not going to go there anymore because we can’t get in. so it’s going to get better and better. we got to stop those drugs, though. we got to stop those drugs. during the campaign, as i traveled all across this country, i met with many american families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws. these american victims were ignored by the media. they were ignored by washington. but they were not ignored by me, and they’re not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer. not going to happen. (applause.) as we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens. one by one — you’re reading about it, right? they’re being thrown out of our country. they’re being thrown into prisons. and we will not let them back in. (applause.) we’re also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism. (applause.) we have seen the devastation from 9/11 to boston to san bernardino — hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the united states courts. right now we have investigations going on all over — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons. we have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and isis. for this reason, i issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur. (applause.) but let me give you the bad news. we don’t like bad news, right? i don’t want to hear — and i’ll turn it into good. but let me give you the bad, the sad news. moments ago, i learned that a district judge in hawaii — part of the much overturned 9th circuit court — and i have to be nice; otherwise i’ll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts. i’ll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world — i will be criticized — i’ll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts. i would never want to do that. a judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries. audience: booo — the president: the order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with. this new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling. this is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach. the law and the constitution give the president the power to suspend immigration when he deems — or she — or she. fortunately, it will not be hillary she. (applause.) when he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country. so we have a lot of lawyers here. we also have a lot of smart people here. let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212f, of the immigration — and you know what i’m talking about, right? can i read this to you? listen to this. now, we’re all smart people. we’re all good students — some are bad students, but even if you’re a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you. ready? so here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it. and it was put here for the security of our country. and this goes beyond me, because there will be other presidents, and we need this. and sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country. it says — now, listen how easy this is. “whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the united states, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he — see, it wasn’t politically correct, because it should say he or she. you know, today they’d say that. actually, that’s the only mistake they made. “as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate.” in other words, if he thinks there’s danger out there, he or she — whoever is president — can say, i’m sorry, folks, not now, please. we’ve got enough problems. (applause.) we’re talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people. (applause.) now, i know you people aren’t skeptical people because nobody would be that way in tennessee. right? nobody — not tennessee. you don’t think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you? no. audience: booo — the president: this ruling makes us look weak — which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me. (applause.) just look at our borders. we’re going to fight this terrible ruling. we’re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the supreme court. (applause.) we’re going to win. we’re going to keep our citizens safe. and regardless, we’re going to keep our citizens safe, believe me. (applause.) even liberal democratic lawyer, alan dershowitz —- good lawyer — just said that we would win this case before the supreme court of the united states. (applause.) remember this, i wasn’t thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let’s tailor it. this is a watered–down version of the first one. this is a watered–down version. and let me tell you something, i think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what i wanted to do in the first one. (applause.) the danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear. i was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless. (applause.) and i will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me. not today, not ever. we’re going to win it. we’re going to win it. (applause.) we’re going to apply common sense. we’re going to apply intelligence. and we’re never quitting, and we’re never going away, and we’re never, ever giving up. the best way to keep foreign terrorists — or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical islamic terrorists — from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place. (applause.) we’ll take it, but these are the problems we have. people are screaming, break up the 9th circuit. and i’ll tell you what, that 9th circuit — you have to see. take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions. take a look. and this is what we have to live with. finally, i want to get to taxes. i want to cut the hell out of taxes, but — (applause) — but before i can do that — i would have loved to have put it first, i’ll be honest — there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous obamacare. (applause.) if we leave obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you’re down to practically no insurers. you’re going to have nobody. you’re going to have nobody. and this is true all over. the insurers are fleeing. the insurers are fleeing. it’s a catastrophic situation, and there’s nothing to compare anything to because obamacare won’t be around for a year or two. it’s gone. so it’s not like, oh, gee, they have this. obamacare is gone. premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases. it will drain our budget and destroy our jobs. remember all of the broken promises? you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. remember the wise guy — remember the wise guy that essentially said the american people — the so–called architect — the american people are stupid because they approved it? we’re going to show them. those in congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare. (applause.) and remember this — remember this: if we took, because there’s such divisiveness — and i’m not just talking now, with me. there was with obama. there was with bush. the level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians. i remember years ago, i’d go to washington — i* was always very politically active — and republicans and democrats, they’d fight during the day and they go to dinner at night. today, there’s a level that nobody has seen before. just remember this: if we submitted the democrats’ plan, drawn everything perfect for the democrats, we wouldn’t get one vote from the democrats. that’s the way it is. that’s how much divisiveness and other things there are. so it’s a problem. but we’re going to get it by. so, i’ve met with so many victims of obamacare —- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation. at the very core of obamacare was a fatal flaw — the government forcing people to buy a government–approved product. there are very few people — very few people. audience member: booo — the president: by the way — watch what happens. now you just booed obamacare. they will say, trump got booed when he mentioned — they’re bad people, folks. they’re bad people. audience: booo — the president: tonight, i’ll go home, i’ll turn on, i’ll say — listen, i’ll turn on that television. my wife will say, darling, it’s too bad you got booed. i said, i didn’t get booed. this was a — i said, no, no, they were booing obamacare. watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed. but when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it. so we’ll see. it’s the fake, fake media. we want americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government. (applause.) the house has put forward a plan to repeal and replace obamacare based on the principles i outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together and we’re going to get something done. remember this — if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the democrats involved. they won’t vote, no matter what we do, they’re not going to vote. so we’re doing it a different way, a complex way. it’s fine. the end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three — it’s going to be great. it’s going to be great. and then, we get on to tax reductions, which i like. (applause.) the house legislation does so much for you. it gives the states medicaid flexibility. and some of the states will take over their healthcare. governor rick scott in florida said, just send me the money — they run a great plan. we have states that are doing great. it gives great flexibility. thank you, folks. thank you. (applause.) it repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in obamacare taxes. it provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs. the bill that i will ultimately sign — and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we’re going to get it done — we’ll get rid of obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family. (applause.) and once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three — i’m going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process. (applause.) we welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we’re going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day — unlike the way obamacare was passed. remember, folks, if we don’t do anything, obamacare is gone. it’s not like, oh, gee, it’s going to be wonderful in three years. it’s gone. it’s gone. it’s gone. not working. it’s gone. what we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from democratic leaders in congress who broke the system in the first place and who don’t believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions. (applause.) i am very confident that if we empower the american people we will accomplish incredible things for our country — not just on healthcare, but all across our government. we will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine. we will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values. (applause.) we will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we’re going to lower taxes. (applause.) and we will fight for the right of every american child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing. (applause.) no matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home. we all salute the same flag. and we all are made by the same god. (applause.) audience: usa! usa! usa! the president: it’s time to embrace our glorious american destiny. anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country. all we have to do is tap into that american pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls. and we found that out very recently in our last election — a lot of pride. (applause.) we are all americans, and the future truly belongs to us. the future belongs to all of you. this is your moment. this is your time. this is the hour when history is made. all we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make america strong again. (applause.) we will make america wealthy again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again. and we will make america great again. (applause.) thank you. god bless you. thank you. (applause.) god bless you, everybody. (applause.)"

   "text": "thank you, everybody. thank you very much. i am thrilled to be here. thrilled. (applause) and if you think that was an easy trip, you’re wrong. but i am thrilled. (laughter) 19th boy scout jamboree, wow, and to address such a tremendous group. boy, you have a lot of people here. the press will say it’s about 200 people. (laughter) it looks like about 45,000 people. you set a record today. (applause) you set a record. that’s a great honor, believe me. tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in washington, d.c. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of that. we’re going to put that… (applause) we’re going to put that aside. and instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young scouts can achieve your dreams, what to think of, what i’ve been thinking about. you want to achieve your dreams, i said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when i’m in front of the boy scouts? right? (applause) there are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the united states. but looking out at this incredible gathering of mostly young patriots. mostly young. i’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the boy scouts of america. (applause) crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: you are the young people of character, integrity who will serve as leaders of our communities and uphold the sacred values of our nation. i want to thank boy scouts president randall stephenson, chief scout executive michael surbaugh, jamboree chairman ralph de la vega and the thousands of volunteers who made this a life-changing experience for all of you. and when they asked me to be here, i said absolutely yes. (applause) finally — and we can’t forgot these people — i especially want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here tonight. (applause) thank you for making scouting possible. thank you, mom and dad, troop leaders. when you volunteer for the boy scouts you are not only shaping young lives, you are shaping the future of america. (applause) the united states has no better citizens than its boy scouts. (applause) no better. (applause) the values, traditions and skills you learn here will serve you throughout your lives. and just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and in the present will serve your country. (applause) the scouts believe in putting america first. (applause) you know, i go to washington and i see all these politicians, and i see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. in fact, today, i said we ought to change it from the word “swamp” to the word “cesspool” or perhaps to the word “sewer.” (applause) but it’s not good. not good. and i see what’s going on. and believe me, i’d much rather be with you, that i can tell you. (applause) i’ll tell you the reason that i love this, and the reason that i really wanted to be here, is because as president, i rely on former boy scouts every single day. and so do the american people. it’s amazing how many boy scouts we have at the highest level of our great government. many of my top advisers in the white house were scouts. ten members of my cabinet were scouts. can you believe that? ten. (applause) secretary of state rex tillerson is not only a boy scout, he is your former national president. (applause) the vice president of the united states, mike pence — a good guy — was a scout, and it meant so much to him. (applause) some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when mike was the governor of indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. and by the way, where are our indiana scouts tonight? (applause) i wonder if the television cameras will follow you? they don’t doing that when they see these massive crowds. they don’t like doing that. hi, folks. (applause) there’s a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. a lot of love. and a lot of love for our country. and a lot of love for our country. secretary of the interior ryan zinke is here tonight. come here, ryan. (applause) ryan is an eagle scout from big sky country in montana. (applause) pretty good. and by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. he makes sure that we leave our national parks and federal lands better than we found them in the best scouting tradition. so thank you very much, ryan. (applause) secretary of energy rick perry of texas, an eagle scout from the great state. (applause) the first time he came to the national jamboree was in 1964. he was very young then. and rick told me just a little while ago, it totally changed his life. so, rick, thank you very much for being here. and we’re doing — we’re doing a lot with energy. (applause) and very soon, rick, we will be an energy exporter. isn’t that nice? an energy exporter. (applause) in other words, we’ll be selling our energy instead of buying it from everybody all over the globe. so that’s good. (applause) we will be energy dominant. and i’ll tell you what, the folks in west virginia who were so nice to me, boy, have we kept our promise. we are going on and on. so we love west virginia. we want to thank you. where’s west virginia by the way? (applause) thank you. secretary tom price is also here today. dr. price still lives the scout oath, helping to keep millions of americans strong and healthy as our secretary of health and human services. and he’s doing a great job. and hopefully he’s going to gets the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as obamacare that’s really hurting us. (applause) crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: by the way, are you going to get the votes? he better get them. he better get them. oh, he better. otherwise i’ll say, “tom, you’re fired.” i’ll get somebody. (applause) he better get senator capito to vote for it. he better get the other senators to vote for it. it’s time. you know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace obamacare we have a chance to now do it. they better do it. hopefully they’ll do it. as we can see just by looking at our government, in america, scouts lead the way. and another thing i’ve noticed — and i’ve noticed it all my life — there is a tremendous spirit with being a scout, more so than almost anything i can think of. so whatever is going on, keep doing it. it’s incredible to watch, believe me. (applause) each of these leaders will tell that you their road to american success — and you have to understand — their american success, and they are a great, great story, was paved with the patriotic american values and traditions they learned in the boy scouts. and some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to say the same, i got my start as a scout, just like these incredibly great people that are doing such a good job for our country. so that’s going to happen. (applause) boy scout values are american values. and great boy scouts become great, great americans. (applause) as the scout law says, a scout is trustworthy, loyal — we could use some more loyalty i will tell that you that. (crowd chanting) that was very impressive. you’ve heard that before. but here you learn the rewards of hard work and perseverance, never, ever give up. never quit. persevere. never, ever quit. you learn the satisfaction of building a roaring campfire, reaching a mountain summit or earning a merit badge after mastering a certain skill. there’s no better feeling than an achievement that you’ve earned with your own sweat, tears, resolve, hard work. there’s nothing like it. do you agree with that? (applause) i’m waving to people back there so small i can’t even see them. man, this is a lot of people. turn those cameras back there, please. that is so incredible. by the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible massive crowd, record setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? one percent or zero? (applause) the fake media will say, “president trump spoke” — you know what is — “president trump spoke before a small crowd of boy scouts today.” that’s some — that is some crowd. fake media. fake news. thank you. and i’m honored by that. by the way, all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. i hope you can hear. through scouting you also learned to believe in yourself — so important — to have confidence in your ability and to take responsibility for your own life. when you face down new challenges — and you will have plenty of them — develop talents you never thought possible, and lead your teammates through daring trials, you discover that you can handle anything. and you learn it by being a scout. it’s great. (applause) you can do anything. you can be anything you want to be. but in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. if you don’t — i love you too. i don’t know. nice guy. (applause) hey, what am i going to do? he sounds like a nice person. he — he, he, he. i do. i do love you. (crowd chanting) by the way, just a question, did president obama ever come to a jamboree? (applause) and we’ll be back. we’ll be back. the answer is no. but we’ll be back. in life, in order to be successful — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? you have to find it. if you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will gain momentum? and look, you have to. you need the word “momentum.” you will gain that momentum. and each success will create another success. the word “momentum.” i’ll tell you a story that’s very interesting for me. when i was young there was a man named william levitt. you have some here. you have some in different states. anybody ever hear of levittown? (applause) and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. and he’d build homes, and at night he’d go to these major sites with teams of people, and he’d scour the sites for nails, and sawdust and small pieces of wood, and they cleaned the site, so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. and he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of money for his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money, at the time especially. this is a long time ago. sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. and he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. i won’t go any more than that, because you’re boy scouts so i’m not going to tell you what he did. (crowd chanting) should i tell you? should i tell you? (applause) you’re boy scouts, but you know life. you know life. so look at you. who would think this is the boy scouts, right? so he had a very, very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood. this was a big conglomerate based in new york city. and after about a 10-year period, there were losing a lot with it. it didn’t mean anything to them. and they couldn’t sell it. so they called william levitt up, and they said, would you like to buy back your company, and he said, yes, i would. he so badly wanted it. he got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the things he did in the south of france and other places. you won’t get bored, right? you know, truthfully, you’re workers. you’ll get bored too, believe me. of course having a few good years like that isn’t so bad. but what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of empty land, and he worked hard at getting zoning, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. he went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older. and i saw him at a cocktail party. and it was very sad because the hottest people in new york were at this party. it was the party of steve ross — steve ross, who was one of the great people. he came up and discovered, really founded time warner, and he was a great guy. he had a lot of successful people at the party. and i was doing well, so i got invited to the party. i was very young. and i go in, but i’m in the real estate business, and i see a hundred people, some of whom i recognize, and they’re big in the entertainment business. and i see sitting in the corner was a little old man who was all by himself. nobody was talking to him. i immediately recognized that that man was the once great william levitt, of levittown, and i immediately went over. i wanted to talk to him more than the hollywood, show business, communications people. so i went over and talked to him, and i said, “mr. levitt, i’m donald trump.” he said, “i know.” i said, “mr. levitt, how are you doing?” he goes, “not well, not well at all.” and i knew that. but he said, “not well at all.” and he explained what was happening and how bad it’s been and how hard it’s been. and i said, “what exactly happened? why did this happen to you? you’re one of the greats ever in our industry. why did this happen to you?” and he said, “donald, i lost my momentum. i lost my momentum.” a word you never hear when you’re talking about success when some of these guys that never made 10 cents, they’re on television giving you things about how you’re going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape. but i tell you — i’ll tell you, it was very sad, and i never forgot that moment. and i thought about it, and it’s exactly true. he lost his momentum, meaning he took this period of time off, long, years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. in life, i always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum. and if you don’t have it, that’s ok. because you’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do things that are great. but you have to know about the word “momentum.” but the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love. when you do something you love as a scout, i see that you love it. but when you do something that you love, you’ll never fail. what you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. you’re ultimately going to be successful. and remember this, you’re not working. because when you’re doing something that you love, like i do — of course i love my business, but this is a little bit different. who thought this was going to happen. we’re, you know, having a good time. we’re doing a good job. (applause) doing a good job. but when you do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. so you’ll work 24/7. you’re going to work all the time. and at the end of the year you’re not really working. you don’t think of it as work. when you’re not doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you really don’t like, that’s called work, and it’s hard work, and tedious work. so as much as you can do something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. (applause) now, with that, i have to tell you our economy is doing great. our stock market has picked up since the election, november 8th — do we remember that day? was that a beautiful day? (applause) what a day. do you remember that famous night on television, november 8th where they said, these dishonest people, where they said, there is no path to victory for donald trump. they forgot about the forgotten people. by the way, they’re not forgetting about the forgotten people anymore. they’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but i told them, far too late; it’s far too late. but you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the republicans are red and the democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. and they didn’t know what to say. (applause) and you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college. popular vote is much easier. we have — because new york, california, illinois, you have to practically run the east coast. and we did. we won florida. we won south carolina. we won north carolina. we won pennsylvania. (applause) we won and won. so when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. you know i went to maine four times because it’s one vote, and we won. we won. one vote. i went there because i kept hearing we’re at 269. but then wisconsin came in. many, many years. michigan came in. (applause) so — and we worked hard there. you know, my opponent didn’t work hard there, because she was told… (booing) she was told she was going to win michigan, and i said, well, wait a minute. the car industry is moving to mexico. why is she going to move — she’s there. why are they allowing it to move? and by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? they’re coming back to michigan. they’re coming back to ohio. they’re starting to peel back in. (applause) and we go to wisconsin, now, wisconsin hadn’t been won in many, many years by a republican. but we go to wisconsin, and we had tremendous crowds. and i’d leave these massive crowds, i’d say, why are we going to lose this state? the polls, that’s also fake news. they’re fake polls. but the polls are saying — but we won wisconsin. (applause) so i have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make america great again. (applause) and i’ll tell you what, we are indeed making america great again. crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: and i’ll tell you what, we are indeed making america great again. what’s going on is incredible. (applause) we had the best jobs report in 16 years. the stock market on a daily basis is hitting an all-time high. we’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars from companies that can’t get their money back into this country, and that money is going to be used to help rebuild america. we’re doing things that nobody ever thought was possible, and we’ve just started. it’s just the beginning, believe me. (applause) you know, in the boy scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? you learn to contribute to your communities, to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. you pledge to help other people at all times. (applause) in the scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your best and to do your duty to god and your country. (applause) and by the way, under the trump administration you’ll be saying “merry christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me. (applause) merry christmas. they’ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. you’re going to be saying “merry christmas” again, folks. (applause) but the words “duty,” “country” and “god” are beautiful words. in other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great american patriot. (applause) for more than a century that is exactly what our boy scouts have been. last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service to helping people in your communities. incredible. that’s an incredible stat. (applause) all of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service by the end of this jamboree — 100,000. (applause) when natural disaster strikes, when people face hardship, when the beauty and glory of our outdoor spaces must be restored and taken care of, america turns to the boy scouts because we know that the boy scouts never ever, ever let us down. (applause) just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. (applause) your values are the same values that have always kept america strong, proud and free. and by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? billions of dollars. (applause) new planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are so great to us. we love our vets. we love our soldiers. and we love our police, by the way. (applause) firemen, police. we love our police. those are all special people. uniformed services. two days ago i traveled to norfolk, virginia to commission an american aircraft carrier into the fleet of the united states navy. (applause) it’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it’s named for an eagle scout — the uss gerald r. ford. (applause) everywhere it sails that great scout’s name will be feared and revered, because that ship will be a symbol of american power, prestige and strength. (applause) our nation honors president gerald r. ford today because he lived his life the scouting way. boy scouts celebrate american patriots, especially the brave members of our armed forces. thank you very much. (applause) thank you. thank you. (applause) american hearts are warmed every year when we read about boy scouts placing thousands and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. by honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. you should take great pride in the example you set for every citizen of our country to follow. (applause) generations of american boy scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. you inherit a noble american tradition. and as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of you who you are and the principles you hold dear and stand by. wear your values as your badge of honor. what you’ve done few have done before you. what you’ve done is incredible. what you’ve done is admired by all. so i want to congratulate you, boy scouts. (applause) let your scouting oath guide your path from this day forward. remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people god put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. (applause) you are very special people. you’re special in the lives of america. you’re special to me. but if you do what we say, i promise you that you will live scouting’s adventure every single day of your life, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. (applause) your lives will have meaning, and purpose and joy. you will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. things that you said could never, ever happen are already happening for you. and if you do these things, and if you refuse to give in to doubt or to fear, then you will help to make america great again, you will be proud of yourself, be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love. (applause) crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: and never, ever forget, america is proud of you. (applause) this is a very, very special occasion for me. i’ve known so many scouts over the years. winners. i’ve known so many great people. they’ve been taught so well, and they love the heritage. but this is very special for me. and i just want to end by saying, very importantly, god bless you. god bless the boy scouts. god bless the united states of america. go out, have a great time in life, compete, and go out and show me that there is nobody, nobody like a boy scout. (applause) thank you very much, everybody. (applause) thank you very much. (applause) thank you. (applause) thank you very much (applause)"

   "text": "what a crowd. (applause) trump: and just so you know from the secret service, there aren’t too many people outside protesting, ok. that i can tell you. (applause) a lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. they can get them in. whatever you can do, fire marshals, we’ll appreciate it. trump: and i want to thank our great vice president, mike pence, for the introduction. (applause) as well as my friend dr. ben carson. (applause) and thank you to a very, very special man, franklin graham, reverend franklin graham, for leading us in prayer. (applause) and thank you too alveda king, the niece of the great dr. martin luther king. (applause) it really shows you that america is indeed a nation of faith, we know that. (applause) well, i’m thrilled to be back in phoenix, in the great state of arizona. (applause) with so many thousands of hard-working american patriots. you know i’d love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. it is incredible. (applause) it is incredible. as everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right? the crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there’s something special happening here. and we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. we love those debates. (applause) but we went to center stage and we never left, right? all of us, we did it together. you were there at the start. you’ve been there every single day since, and i will never forget. believe me, arizona, i will never forget. (applause) and i’m here tonight to send a message: we are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done. (applause) this evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values. we love our country. we celebrate our troops. we embrace our freedom. we respect our flag. we are proud of our history. we cherish our constitution, including, by the way, the second amendment. crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: we fully protect religious liberty. we believe in law and order. and we support the incredible men and of law enforcement. (applause) and we pledge our allegiance to one nation under god. (applause) you always understood what washington, d.c. did not. our movement is a movement built on love. it’s love for fellow citizens. it’s love for struggling americans who’ve been left behind, and love for every american child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true. trump: from the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the sun belt to the rust belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every american from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first. (applause) it is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great american workers deserve, and that’s what we’re doing. (applause) crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: after our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women — remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election? guess what? they’re not forgotten… (applause) trump: … anymore (ph), right? anymore. no, they’re not forgotten anymore folks. in fact, they’re trying to figure you out. they’re saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us? i don’t think that’s going to happen any time soon. we believe that every american has the right to live with dignity. respect for america demands respect for all of its people. loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, we all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. a wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. you saw last night. you saw last night. (applause) did anybody watch last night? yes. (applause) when one part of america hurts, we all hurt. and when one american suffers an injustice, all of america suffers together. we’re all together. it’s time for us to follow the example of our brave american soldiers. and i was with a lot of them last night, fort myers. (applause) no matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team. that’s what we are. we’re a team. as a nation, we’re a team. (applause) they’re all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission. it’s time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team. we are all americans, and we all believe right now in america first. (applause) and it’s happening, and it’s happening fast. i see all those red hats and white hats. it’s all happening very fast. it’s called “make america great again.” you see what’s going on. (applause) it’s coming back, very fast. we want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling american to have a chance for a better life. what happened in charlottesville strikes at the core of america. and tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence. (applause) but the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras. (booing) so the — and i mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories. they have no sources in many cases. they say “a source says” — there is no such thing. but they don’t report the facts. just like they don’t want to report that i spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-nazis, the white supremacists, and the kkk. (applause) i openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there. so what i did — (applause) so what i did is i thought, i’d take just a second, and i’m really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, ok? (applause) i’m really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are. (booing) so here is my first statement when i heard about charlottesville — and i have a home in charlottesville, a lot of people don’t know. here’s the first — can’t believe they haven’t figured that one out yet. now they know. now they finally know. but i — i just — i don’t want to bore you with this, but i — it shows you how dishonest they are. and most of you know this anyway. so here’s what i said, really fast, here’s what i said on saturday: “we’re closely following the terrible events unfolding in charlottesville, virginia” — this is me speaking. we condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.” that’s me speaking on saturday. (applause) right after the event. (applause) so i’m condemning the strongest, possible terms, “egregious display,” “hatred, bigotry and violence.” ok, i think i can’t do much better, right? ok. but they didn’t want to put this on. they had it on initially, but then one day he talked (ph) — he didn’t say it fast enough. he didn’t do it on time. why did it take a day? he must be a racist. it took a day. (booing) dishonest people. so here is — here is me — i hope they’re showing how many people are in this room, but they won’t. they don’t even do that. the only time they show the crowds is when there’s a disrupter or an anarchist in the room. i call them anarchists. because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists. they don’t want to talk about the anarchists. so this is me — “it has no place in america.” i’m talking about hatred, bigotry and violence. “it has no place in america. what is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. no citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.” this is me speaking. (applause) here’s further. this is on saturday, the first one. i did this three times. “we have to come together as americans with love for the nation and true affection, really” — and i say this so strongly — “true affection for each other.” i didn’t say true affection for you and you. i said for each other, all of us. all of us. all of us. (applause) but they don’t report it. they don’t — they just let it go. “above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all americans first. we love our country, we love our god, and we love our flag.” (applause) crowd: usa! usa! usa! trump: and then i went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn’t specific enough. why wasn’t he more specific? so in my second statement, i got really specific, and they said, why didn’t he do it faster? the — i’m telling you folks, look, look, i know these people probably better than anybody. and a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they’re doing a story about me, i know if it’s honest or false. if you’re reading a story about somebody, you don’t know. you assume it’s honest, because it’s like the failing new york times, which is like so bad. it’s so bad. (booing) or the washington post, which call a lobbying tool for amazon, ok, that’s a lobbying tool for amazon. or cnn, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down. (booing) right? crowd: cnn sucks! cnn sucks! cnn sucks! trump: but all the networks — i mean, cnn is really bad, but abc this morning — i don’t watch it much, but i’m watching in the morning, and they have little george stephanopoulos talking to nikki haley, right? little george. and — and he talks about the speech i made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right? (applause) they had a hard time. they were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing — we were saying things — and it really did. so, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, “let’s get back to charlottesville.” charlottesville. and nikki was great. she’s doing a great job, by the way. so now, i say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country. i love the people of our country, the people, all of the people. it says i love all of the people of our country. i didn’t say i love you because you’re black, or i love you because you’re white, or i love you because you’re from japan, or you’re from china, or you’re from kenya, or you’re from scotland or sweden. i love all the people of our country. (applause) so, i said here’s my — this is — by the way folks, this is my exact words: “i love all the people of our country. we’re going to make america great again, but we’re going to make it great for all of the people of the united states of america.” (applause) and then they say, is he a racist? is he a racist? then, i did a second one. so then i did a second one. don’t bother, it’s only a single voice. and not a very powerful voice. how did he get in here? he’s supposed to be with the few people outside. how about — how about all week they’re talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside. where are they? well, it’s hot out. it is hot. i think it’s too warm. you know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they’ve got clubs and they’ve got everything — antifa! so on august the 14th — so that was it, and i said all people, i love all people, everything, right? now i figure i’m going to do it again. i’ll be even more specific. so i said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in charlottesville, i’d like to provide the nation with an update. because that was right after the event, the first one, right? an update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody. to anyone who acted criminally in this weekend’s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered. that’s what i said. (applause) listen to that, i said that, but they don’t show that. they don’t show it. they take — they’ll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing. he was late. so i said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence. ok, then i go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence. we must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as americans, right? then i said, racism is evil. do they report that i said that racism is evil? trump: you know why? because they are very dishonest people. so i said, racism is evil. now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy i am. but, i mean do you ever see anything — and then you wonder why cnn is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. because they’re putting like seven people all negative on trump. and they fired jeffrey lord, poor jeffrey. jeffrey lord. i guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard. they said, we’ve better get out of here; we can’t have that. and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the kkk, neo-nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as americans. now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness? and you know i mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, barack obama never said it took place because of radical islamic terrorists, he never said that, right. he doesn’t have to say… (booing) you know why? because they have a double standard. because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard. you never heard them say that. and in fact, if you use the term you’d get criticized. but with me, they wanted me to say it, and i said it. and i said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on. “those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of america.” these are my words. this was on monday, august 14th. so you had saturday; you had monday. you know, i was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right. “in times such as these, america has always shown its true character. responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.” and then i finished, i said, “we will defend or protect the sacred rights of all americans.” all is capitalized times five. not just you. “and we will work together so that every citizen — every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls.” (applause) ok now, i mean — so they were having a hard time with that one, because i said everything. i hit him with neo-nazi. i hit them with everything. i got the white supremacists, the neo-nazi. i got them all in there, let’s say. kkk, we have kkk. i got them all. so they’re having a hard time. so what are they say, right? it should have been sooner. he’s a racist. it should have been sooner, ok. so it should have been — so then the last one, on tuesday — tuesday i did another one: “we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. it has no place in america.” (applause) but they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed heather, and it’s a terrible thing. but they said i didn’t mention, so these are my words. “the driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing.” they said i didn’t mention it. and then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the united states? now i have to say they were pretty bad under barack obama, that i can tell you. but, they asked me the question. and i said, well, i think jobs can have a very big and positive impact. i think if we continue to create jobs like i’ve done — over one million since i’ve been in office… (applause) trump: way over one million. i think if we continue to create jobs at levels that i’m creating jobs, i think that’s going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. i do. i do. and the other thing — very important — i believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in 17 years, so you’re going to see wages go up, right? (applause) they haven’t gone up for a long time. i believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, i believe wages will start to go up, and i think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. (applause) trump: so that was my words. now, you know, i was a good student. i always hear about the elite. you know, the elite. they’re elite? i went to better schools than they did. i was a better student than they were. i live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and i live in the white house, too, which is really great. (applause) trump: i think — you know what? i think we’re the elites. they’re not the elites. (applause) so the point is — and i didn’t want to bore you, because you understand where i’m coming from. you people understand. but the point is, that those were three different — there were two statements and one news conference. the words were perfect. they only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. but they don’t put on those words. and they don’t put on me saying those words. the media can attack me. but where i draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do. when they attack the decency of our supporters. (applause) you are honest, hard-working, taxpaying — and by the way, you’re overtaxed, but we’re going to get your taxes down. (applause) trump: you’re taxpaying americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people. it’s time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions. (applause) and yes, by the way — and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage. you see that. (booing) trump: and — and i say it, and you know, we’re all pros. we’re all, like, we have a certain sense. we’re smart people. these are truly dishonest people. and not all of them. not all of them. you have some very good reporters. you have some very fair journalists. but for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they’re bad people. and i really think they don’t like our country. i really believe that. and i don’t believe they’re going to change, and that’s why i do this. if they would change, i would never say it. the only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news. (applause) trump: oh, that’s so funny. look back there, the live red lights. they’re turning those suckers off fast out there. they’re turning those lights off fast. like cnn. cnn does not want its falling viewership to watch what i’m saying tonight, i can tell you. i mean, the advantage i have — the advantage i have is that we do have a big voice. and you know, they’re always saying, like twitter or social media — if i didn’t have social media, i wouldn’t be able to get the word out. i probably wouldn’t be standing here, right? i probably wouldn’t be standing here right now. (applause) if i don’t have social media, i probably would not be standing. and do you ever notice, when i go on and i’ll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, “he’s in a twitter-storm again!” i — i don’t do twitter-storms. you know, you’ll put out a little tweet: “i’m going to be with the veterans today.” they’ll say, “donald trump is in a twitter-storm.” these are sick people. you know the thing i don’t understand? you would think — you would think they’d want to make our country great again, and i honestly believe they don’t. i honestly believe it. if you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media… (applause) … which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth. i mean, the new york times has written some stories. how about this? the new york times essentially apologized after i won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. i would say they did. they say, well, it wasn’t really that much of an apology. because they were losing so many people, because they were misled. and i figured, this is great. and for about two weeks i got good coverage. then they reverted back into worse than ever before. you know, it’s like one of those things. the washington post is terrible. but these are dishonest — but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers. you have some great networks. i must tell you, fox has treated me fairly. fox treated me fairly. (applause) trump: they’ve treated me fairly. hey, i’ll let you know. you know what? some day they might not treat me fairly, and i’ll tell you about it, ok? but they’ve treated me fairly, and i don’t mean all good. i get plenty of bad on fox, too. but at least it’s within reason. and hannity? how good is hannity (inaudible)? how good is hannity? (applause) trump: and he’s a great guy, and he’s an honest guy. and “fox and friends in the morning” is the best show, and it’s the absolute, most honest show, and it’s the show i watch. not only does — oh boy, those cameras are going off. oh, wow. why don’t you just fold them up and take them home? oh, those cameras are going off. wow. that’s the one thing, they’re very nervous to have me on live television, because this can (ph) happen. now, you know what? i’m a person that wants to tell the truth. i’m an honest person, and what i’m saying, you know is exactly right. not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should’ve never been allowed to be politicians. (applause) and the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job. (applause) my administration is committed to the idea that all americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace. we believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe. and how safe are you at a trump rally? (applause) remember at the beginning, remember when this already started? when this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs. they had — our people are tougher than them, so it wasn’t always very good for them. but they’d send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you’d go home and you’d watch this violence. let me tell you, see this room? you’ve got people outside, but not very many. but see this room? you’re safe in this room. you’re very safe in this room. (applause) it’s a big room. the most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws. (applause) by the way, i’m just curious. do the people in this room like sheriff joe? (applause) so, was sheriff joe convicted for doing his job? that’s why… (applause) he should have had a jury, but you know what? i’ll make a prediction. i think he’s going to be just fine, ok? (applause) but — but i won’t do it tonight, because i don’t want to cause any controversy. is that ok? all right? (applause) but sheriff joe can feel good. the people of arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking. ms-13 — we’re throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this. we are liberating towns out on long island. we’re liberating. can you imagine, in this day and age — in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns. this is like from a different age. we are taking these people. they don’t shoot people, because it’s too fast and not painful. they cut them up into little pieces. these are animals. we are getting them out of here. we’re throwing them in jails, and we’re throwing them out of the country. we’re liberating our towns. (applause) you’re seen it. you’ve lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it. and we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it. that i can tell you. (applause) after years of defending other countries borders — can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders — we’re finally defending our own borders. (applause) and we’re showing compassion for these struggling american workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country. and by the way, we’re doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in. we have foxconn, they make the iphones, as you know, for apple, and so many companies are building now in our country. (applause) including the auto companies who are coming back. years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they’ve put great burdens on local schools and hospitals. while this may be good for a handful of special interests, it’s unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country. we want every american community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can’t do that if we don’t control our borders. (applause) earlier today, i visited with the incredible men and women of ice and the border patrol during a visit to yuma sector. trump: i was over at the yuma sector. it was hot. it was like 115 degrees. i’m out signing autographs for an hour. i was there. that was a hot day. you learn if you’re in shape if you can do that, believe me. and they actually told me — actually, sir, it’s relatively cool today. can you believe that? (laughter) but it was great. and i met with the border patrol and i met with ice, and these are incredible people; the job they do. (applause) and in fact, general kelly, who was in charge of homeland security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent. he did so good, i made him my chief of staff, right? that made sense. john, where’s john? where is he? where’s general kelly? get him out here. he’s great. he’s doing a great job. but we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot. we respect and cherish our ice officers and our border patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services. (applause) but during that visit, i heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and i pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe. all around the nation, i have spent time with the wonderful americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws. and i promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain. i promised them. i know so many of them. (applause) one by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people. we are throwing them out of the country or we’re putting the hell, fast in jail. (applause) we are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally. (applause) and we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary. (applause) crowd: build that wall! build that wall! build that wall! trump: build that wall. now the obstructionist democrats would like us not to do it. but believe me, if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall. let me be very clear to democrats in congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: you are putting all of america’s safety at risk. you’re doing that. you’re doing that. again, the border patrol today, i said, how important is the wall to some of the folks? i met with a lot of them. and they looked at me, they said, it’s vital. it’s vital. it’s so vital. and you know, we have walls. i don’t know if you know, we’re already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don’t have to rebuild them. and we want walls that you can see through in a sense. you want to see what’s on the other side. but we’re starting to fix a lot of the walls. we’ve done a lot of work. but i said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls? and they said, mr. president, you have no idea. it is desperately needed. we’re going to have our wall. we’re going to get our wall. (applause) and that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border. (applause) my administration will never back down in demanding immigration control. the american people voted for immigration control. that’s one of the reasons i’m here, and that is what the american people deserve, and they’re going to get it. (applause) so you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we’re going to get that wall. immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security. that’s why we’re implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country. (applause) you look at what just happened in spain and so many other places. nope. we’re really vetting. we’re tough. does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like — crowd: no! trump: “extreme vetting” — i came up with that term. that’s what it has to be. so i have a message for congress tonight: you’re job is to represent american families, american people, american workers. that’s your job. (applause) you need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare — one vote — and on every other issue that affects their lives. and for our friends in the senate, oh boy — the senate, remember this — look, the senate, we have to get rid of what’s called the filibuster rule; we have to. and if we don’t, the republicans will never get anything passed. you’re wasting your time. we have to get rid of the filibuster rule. right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 republicans. that means that eight democrats are controlling all of this legislation. we have over 200 bills. (booing) and we have to speak to mitch and we have to speak to everybody. and i want to tell you, we have some great, great republican senators. we really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved. they fought. they really did. they really fought. now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don’t know, it doesn’t matter. it’s a trick. we needed 51 votes. but when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us. he’s the greatest. but you have no margin. but some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes. so even when you say we’re voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines. one of the most important things, i’ve been talking about it for two years during debates. it gives competition. insurance companies come in, your prices go way down. arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest. you got to get rid of the filibuster rule. you’ve got to go to a majority. you’ve got to go to 51 votes, and if they don’t do that they’re — they’re just wasting time. all of the democrats in congress, that’s the only thing they do well. they do one thing well. you know what it’s called? they have no ideas. they have no policies. they obstruct. that’s all they do. they’re word is, we resist. they don’t resist; they obstruct. it’s all they’re good at. it’s all they’re good at. that’s all they do. on healthcare, they have 48 democrats. we got no votes. we got no votes. and it would have been great healthcare. and by the way, would have been great healthcare for arizona. would have been great. so the democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what i’m seeing. (booing) under they’re plan for america, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country. (booing) obamacare is a disaster and think — think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace. one vote away. one vote away. we were one vote away. think of it, seven years the republicans — and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it. (crowd chanting) but, you know, they all said, mr. president, your speech was so good last night, please, please, mr. president don’t mention any names. so i won’t. i won’t. no i won’t vote — one vote away, i will not mention any names. very presidential, isn’t’ it? very presidential. and nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who’s weak on borders, weak on crime, so i won’t talk about him. (booing) nobody wants me to talk about him. nobody knows who the hell he is. and now — see, i haven’t’ mentioned any names. so now, everybody’s happy. but we are going to get rid of obamacare. i will never stop — one vote — i will never stop. we’re going to get rid of obamacare. every day we’re keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans. who’s a veteran here? (applause) it’s getting better, getting really good. nobody’s fixed it — nobody’s been able to do it. and remember, i’m only here for less than eight months, you know. when they talk about obamacare, it was years. when they talk hillary clinton spent eight years trying to get… (booing) eight years trying to get health care. (crowd chanting) well, it’s obvious that we won the state of arizona, do you agree with that? it’s pretty obvious. and we won it by a lot. and i hear we’re winning it by even more right now. but if you think about it, clinton, they spent eight years that they weren’t able to get health care. other administrations spent all of their time, they weren’t able to get it. obama, what he did to get it. what he did to get it, including the guy, gruber. did you see gruber got fired yesterday? he got fired because he defrauded somebody or something. something very bad happened. check it out. something happened. gruber, who lied about obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it. obamacare is gone. it’s a disaster. it’s gone. premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of arizona. insurance companies are fleeing, and it’s gone. so we’re going to — i really believe that the republicans — and maybe we’ll get a couple of senators that think they’re going to lose their race on the democratic side, maybe, but we’ll get it fixed. one vote — speak to your senator, please. speak to your senator. we’re reforming the v.a. to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice — choice — choice. in other words, if you’ve got to wait for seven days and you’re not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor. isn’t that good? and we’ve got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible. it’s called v.a. accountability. if somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them. we say you’re fired; get out of here. everybody said — everybody said you couldn’t get that — they’ve been trying to get that passed for 40 years. we got great legislation. you ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but trump hasn’t gotten — i think we’ve gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months, i think we’ve gotten more than anybody, including harry truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we’ve got none. so we got v.a. accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren’t doing their jobs. isn’t that great? (applause) we’ve also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict. we believe in peace through strength. we’re building up our military like never before. (applause) thousands and thousands of brave americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. now it’s up to us to preserve and protect their legacy. last night, as you know, i laid out my vision for i’m honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, afghanistan. this is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly united states fans, can i say that? and i will tell you then what we’re going to do with our incredible military, they’re going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they’ve already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice. but we’re fighting for them. our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they’ve earned to fight and to win. fight and to win. (applause) and you see what’s going on in north korea. all of a sudden, i don’t know — who knows. but i can tell you, what i said, that’s not strong enough. some people said it’s too strong, it’s not strong enough. but kim jong un, i respect the fact that i believe he is starting to respect us. i respect that fact very much. respect that fact. and maybe — probably not — but maybe something positive can come about. they won’t tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about. every american deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them. and by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he’s now inside, but he said i want to spend my time outside on security. i said, i think that’s a great idea, governor. but not that many people showed up so i don’t think it should be much of a problem. but you have a hell of a governor, governor ducey. you have a great governor. (applause) and we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, trent franks. where is congressman franks? where is he? get over here. (applause) paul gosar, congressman, congressman andy biggs. get up here, fellow. thank you, fellows. (applause) thank you, congressman. never let them go, folks. never let them go. don’t ever lose them. thank you, fellows. (applause) so, in washington, we’re taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, ok? for us. the same failed voices in washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs. we don’t need advice from the washington, d.c. swamp. (booing) we need, right now, to drain the swamp. that’s what’s happening, too, believe me. washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves. but i don’t come to washington for me. you know, i’ve had a great life. i’ve had great success. i’ve enjoyed my life. most people think i’m crazy to have done this. and i think they’re right. but i enjoy it, because we’ve made so much — i don’t believe that any president — i don’t believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months. i really don’t believe it. (applause) including — including a great supreme court justice, justice gorsuch. big (inaudible). (applause) i came to washington for you. your dreams are my dreams. your hopes are my hopes. and your future is what i’m fighting for each and every day. it’s so important. our agenda is the pro-worker agenda. we’ve accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time. we’ve signed more than 50 pieces of legislation. they said we’ve signed none — none. we’ve signed 50; appointed justice gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way. (applause) so, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we’re unleashing job-creating american energy like we’ve never unleashed before. (applause) we’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it’s just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they’re going to take out clean coal — meaning, they’re taking out coal. they’re going to clean it — is opening in the state of pennsylvania, the second one (ph). (applause) and the state of west virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of gdp increase, second last quarter to the state of texas. how about that? west virginia. and they have a great governor in west virginia, governor jim justice, who just quit the democrats and joined the republican party. (applause) in the proud tradition of america’s great leaders, from george washington — please, don’t take his statue down, please. please. does anybody want george washington’s statue? no. is that sad? is that all (ph) sad? to lincoln, to teddy roosevelt, i see they want to take teddy roosevelt’s down, too. they’re trying to figure out why. they don’t know. they’re trying to take away our culture. they are trying to take away our history. trump: and our weak leaders, they do it overnight. these things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years. you go back to a university, and it’s gone. weak, weak people. we are going to protect american industry. we are going to protect the american worker. no longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. we are building our future with american hands, american labor, american iron, aluminum, and steel. (applause) we will buy american, and we will hire american. i immediately withdrew the united states from the disastrous trans-pacific partnership. would have been a disaster. (applause) and you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into. we have begun formal renegotiation with mexico and canada on nafta. (applause) and i must be honest, and i’ve been talking about nafta for a long time, and i’m sorry it’s taken six months, but we have to give notice. you have to see this. we have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time. then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time. anyway, we started two days ago, bob lighthizer. personally, i don’t think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ they have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, mexico, that i don’t think we can make a deal. so i think we’ll end up probably terminating nafta at some point, ok? probably. (applause) but — but i told you from the first day, we will renegotiate nafta, or we will terminate nafta. i personally don’t think you can make a deal without a termination, but we’re going to see what happens, ok? you’re in — you’re in good hands, i can tell you. we are unleashing american energy, and i withdrew the united states from the job-killing paris climate accord. (applause) people have no idea how bad that was for this country. great for other countries. we were like the lap dog. great for other countries. our country was so behind. since i took the oath of office, we’ve added far more than one million jobs in the private sector. unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low. wages are rising. the stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent. remember, everybody said you won’t bring it up to 1 percent. you won’t bring it up to 1.2 percent. and we’ve just started. those regulations that we’ve gotten rid of, which — and we’re going to have some regulation, but it’s going to be sensible regulation. those regulations are unleashing our economy. so we have a gdp, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent. remember, i said we’re going to try and hit 3 percent? we’re already at 2.6. maybe i’ll have to increase my offer. (applause) and so many of those people, you know, the economic council? when it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, oh, we’ll take a pass. not all of them, but some of them did. but i remember the ones that did. but they’ll say, we take — oh, we’ll take — but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we’ll take a pass — don, can we get together for lunch? let’s do it privately, instead of through a council. these people just don’t get it. they are calling, and they’re saying, how about getting together privately? they like it better. why should they be on a council? you know, that’s the way it is, folks. that’s the way it is. to bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years. (applause) now, we need the help of congress, please. ok? we need the help of congress. and we really could use some democrat help. we’re giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. the democrats are going to find a way to obstruct. if they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut. just remember that, ok? america’s crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound. we have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country. that is why we are going to lower the tax on american business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to america. we want more products stamped with the letters, “made in the u.s.a.”. (applause) we also want everyday americans to be able to keep more of their own money. so for the democratic senators, especially the ones where i won their states by 20 and 30 points, i really hope you’re going to come over to our side. because again, when you have 52 republicans, if you lose like two, that’s the end. you know what, as good as something is, it’s hard to get 51 out of 52. so i hope some of the democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy. (applause) it’s time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families. we will make america the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again. we want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. (applause) we’re going to do an infrastructure bill. we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. american hands will build this future. american energy will power this future. we have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently. (applause) and american workers will bring this future to life. we are the nation that dug out the panama canal, won two world wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism. (applause) we can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything. it’s time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot. americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny. we live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same almighty god. (applause) as long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach. we are americans, and the future belongs to us. the future belongs to all of you. (applause) this is our moment. this is our chance. this is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in america. freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before. so to americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: we will make america strong again. we will make america wealthy again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again. and we will make america great again. (applause) thank you arizona. god bless you. thank you. thank you."

   "speechtitle": "Trump's Remarks On Iran Nuclear Deal",
   "speechdate": "October 2017",
   "speechlocation": "The White House",
   "text": "thank you very much. my fellow americans: as president of the united states, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the american people. history has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. for this reason, upon taking office, i.ve ordered a complete strategic review of our policy toward the rogue regime in iran. that review is now complete. trump calls iran nuclear deal .unacceptable,. but leaves u.s. in it for now politics trump calls iran nuclear deal .unacceptable,. but leaves u.s. in it for now today, i am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps we are taking to confront the iranian regime.s hostile actions and to ensure that iran never, and i mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the middle east and all around the world. iran is under the control of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule. this radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the world.s oldest and most vibrant nations, and spread death, destruction, and chaos all around the globe. beginning in 1979, agents of the iranian regime illegally seized the u.s. embassy in tehran and held more than 60 americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. the iranian-backed terrorist group hezbollah twice bombed our embassy in lebanon “ once in 1983 and again in 1984. another iranian-supported bombing killed 241 americans “ service members they were, in their barracks in beirut in 1983. in 1996, the regime directed another bombing of american military housing in saudi arabia, murdering 19 americans in cold blood. iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al qaeda.s bombing of the american embassies in kenya, tanzania, and two years later, killing 224 people, and wounding more than 4,000 others. the regime harbored high-level terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, including osama bin laden.s son. in iraq and afghanistan, groups supported by iran have killed hundreds of american military personnel. what is “ and isn.t “ covered by the iranian nuclear deal parallels what is “ and isn.t “ covered by the iranian nuclear deal the iranian dictatorship.s aggression continues to this day. the regime remains the world.s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and provides assistance to al qaeda, the taliban, hezbollah, hamas, and other terrorist networks. it develops, deploys, and proliferates missiles that threaten american troops and our allies. it harasses american ships and threatens freedom of navigation in the arabian gulf and in the red sea. it imprisons americans on false charges. and it launches cyberattacks against our critical infrastructure, financial system, and military. the united states is far from the only target of the iranian dictatorship.s long campaign of bloodshed. the regime violently suppresses its own citizens; it shot unarmed student protestors in the street during the green revolution. this regime has fueled sectarian violence in iraq, and vicious civil wars in yemen and syria. in syria, the iranian regime has supported the atrocities of bashar al-assad.s regime and condoned assad.s use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children. given the regime.s murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future. the regime.s two favorite chants are death to america and death to israel. realizing the gravity of the situation, the united states and the united nations security council sought, over many years, to stop iran.s pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. but the previous administration lifted these sanctions, just before what would have been the total collapse of the iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with iran. this deal is known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa. as i have said many times, the iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the united states has ever entered into. the same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries. we need negotiators who will much more strongly represent america.s interest. 6 things you should know about the iran nuclear deal the two-way 6 things you should know about the iran nuclear deal the nuclear deal threw iran.s dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created. it also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over $100 billion dollars its government could use to fund terrorism. the regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the united states, a large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into iran. just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the iranians waiting at the airport for the cash. i wonder where all that money went. worst of all, the deal allows iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program. and importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout. in other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in iran.s path to nuclear weapons. what is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays iran.s nuclear capability for a short period of time? this, as president of the united states, is unacceptable. in other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time. the saddest part of the deal for the united states is that all of the money was paid up front, which is unheard of, rather than at the end of the deal when they have shown they.ve played by the rules. but what.s done is done, and that.s why we are where we are. the iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. for example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. until recently, the iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges. the iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for. iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites, even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of iran.s clandestine nuclear weapons program. there are also many people who believe that iran is dealing with north korea. i am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed. by its own terms, the iran deal was supposed to contribute to regional and international peace and security. and yet, while the united states adheres to our commitment under the deal, the iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the middle east and beyond. importantly, iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal. what.s next for the iran nuclear deal if president trump refuses to recertify it? parallels what.s next for the iran nuclear deal if president trump refuses to recertify it? so today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by iran, and after extensive consultations with our allies, i am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of iran.s destructive actions. first, we will work with our allies to counter the regime.s destabilizing activity and support for terrorist proxies in the region. second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. third, we will address the regime.s proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. and finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon. today, i am also announcing several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. the execution of our strategy begins with the long-overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on iran.s islamic revolutionary guard corps. the revolutionary guard is the iranian supreme leader.s corrupt personal terror force and militia. it has hijacked large portions of iran.s economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad. this includes arming the syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in washington, d.c. i am authorizing the treasury department to further sanction the entire islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support for terrorism and to apply sanctions to its officials, agents, and affiliates. i urge our allies to join us in taking strong actions to curb iran.s continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior, including thorough sanctions outside the iran deal that target the regime.s ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. finally, on the grave matter of iran.s nuclear program: since the signing of the nuclear agreement, the regime.s dangerous aggression has only escalated. at the same time, it has received massive sanctions relief while continuing to develop its missiles program. iran has also entered into lucrative business contracts with other parties to the agreement. when the agreement was finalized in 2015, congress passed the iran nuclear agreement review act to ensure that congress.s voice would be heard on the deal. among other conditions, this law requires the president, or his designee, to certify that the suspension of sanctions under the deal is appropriate and proportionate to measure “ and other measures taken by iran to terminate its illicit nuclear program. based on the factual record i have put forward, i am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. we will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of iran.s nuclear breakout. that is why i am directing my administration to work closely with congress and our allies to address the deal.s many serious flaws so that the iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. these include the deal.s sunset clauses that, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on iran.s nuclear program. the flaws in the deal also include insufficient enforcement and near total silence on iran.s missile programs. congress has already begun the work to address these problems. key house and senate leaders are drafting legislation that would amend the iran nuclear agreement review act to strengthen enforcement, prevent iran from developing an inter- “ this is so totally important “ an intercontinental ballistic missile, and make all restrictions on iran.s nuclear activity permanent under u.s. law. so important. i support these initiatives. however, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. it is under continuous review, and our participation can be cancelled by me, as president, at any time. as we have seen in north korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the worse that threat becomes. it is why we are determined that the world.s leading sponsor of terrorism will never obtain nuclear weapons. in this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the iranian regime.s longest-suffering victims: its own people. the citizens of iran have paid a heavy price for the violence and extremism of their leaders. the iranian people long to “ and they just are longing, to reclaim their country.s proud history, its culture, its civilization, its cooperation with its neighbors. we hope that these new measures directed at the iranian dictatorship will compel the government to reevaluate its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. we hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the middle east ’- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own citizens. we pray for a future where young children “ american and iranian, muslim, christian, and jewish “ can grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. and, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep america safe. thank you, god bless you, and god bless america. thank you."

but before i provide the details of our new strategy, i want to say a few words to the service members here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts and to all americans listening at home. since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage and resolve is unmatched in human history. american patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom. through their lives, and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality. by following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one nation, under god. the men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission and one shared sense of purpose. they transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed and color to serve together and sacrifice together in absolutely perfect cohesion. that is because all service members are brothers and sisters. they’re all part of the same family. it’s called the american family. they take the same oath, fight for the same flag and live according to the same law. they’re bound together by common purpose, mutual trust and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other. the soldier understands what we as a nation too often forget, that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. when one part of america hurts, we all hurt. and when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together. loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another. love for america requires love for all of its people. when we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry and no tolerance for hate. the young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home. we cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other. as we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas — and we will always win — let us find the courage to heal our divisions within. let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name, that when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one. thanks to the vigilance and skill of the american military, and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of sept. 11 — and nobody can ever forget that — have not been repeated on our shores. and we must acknowledge the reality i’m here to talk about tonight, that nearly 16 years after the sept. 11 attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the american people are weary of war without victory. nowhere is this more evident than with the war in afghanistan, the longest war in american history, 17 years. i share the american people’s frustration. i also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money — and most importantly, lives — trying to rebuild countries in our own image instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations. that is why shortly after my inauguration, i directed secretary of defense mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in afghanistan and south asia. my original instinct was to pull out. and historically, i like following my instincts. but all my life i’ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the oval office, in other words, when you’re president of the united states. so i studied afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. after many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last friday at camp david with my cabinet and generals to complete our strategy. i arrived at three fundamental conclusion about america’s core interests in afghanistan. first, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives. the men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory. they deserve the tools they need and the trust they have earned to fight and to win. second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable. 9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists. a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including isis and al qaeda, would instantly fill just as happened before sept. 11. and as we know, in 2011, america hastily and mistakenly withdrew from iraq. as a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for and bled to liberate, and won, were occupied by a terrorist group called isis. the vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for isis to spread, to grow, recruit and launch attacks. we cannot repeat in afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in iraq. third, and finally, i concluded that the security threats we face in afghanistan and the broader region are immense. today, 20 u.s.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in afghanistan and pakistan, the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world. for its part, pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror. the threat is worse because pakistan and india are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict. and that could happen. no one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in afghanistan and south asia. but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions. when i became president, i was given a bad and very complex hand. but i fully knew what i was getting into, big and intricate problems. but one way or another, these problems will be solved. i’m a problem solver. and in the end, we will win. we must address the reality of the world as it exists right now, and the threats we face and the confronting of all of the problems of today, and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal. we need look no further than last week’s vile, vicious attack in barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women and children. you saw it for yourself. horrible. as i outlined in my speech in saudi arabia three months ago, america and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology. terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next. they are nothing but thugs and criminals and predators and — that’s right — losers. working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders and, yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily. in afghanistan and pakistan, america’s interests are clear. we must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten america. and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. but to prosecute this war, we will learn from history. as a result of our comprehensive review, american strategy in afghanistan and south asia will change dramatically in the following ways. a core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. i’ve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the united states to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin or end military options. we will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on. america’s enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. newsletter sign upcontinue reading the main story the interpreter newsletter understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week. enter your email address sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times.s products and services. see sample privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime i will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will. another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of american power — diplomatic, economic, and military — toward a successful outcome. someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the taliban in afghanistan. but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen. america will continue its support for the afghan government and the afghan military as they confront the taliban in the field. ultimately, it is up to the people of afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society and to achieve an everlasting peace. we are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society. we are not nation-building again. we are killing terrorists. the next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach in how to deal with pakistan. we can no longer be silent about pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond. pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in afghanistan. it has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists. in the past, pakistan has been a valued partner. our militaries have worked together against common enemies. the pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism. we recognize those contributions and those sacrifices. but pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people. we have been paying pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. but that will have to change. and that will change immediately. no partnership can survive a country’s harboring of militants and terrorists who target u.s. service members and officials. it is time for pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace. another critical part of the south asia strategy for america is to further develop its strategic partnership with india, the world’s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the united states. we appreciate india’s important contributions to stability in afghanistan, but india makes billions of dollars in trade with the united states, and we want them to help us more with afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. we are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in south asia and the broader indo-pacific region. finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the american people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work, and work effectively, and work quickly. i have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our war fighters that prevented the secretary of defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy. micromanagement from washington, d.c., does not win battles. they’re won in the field, drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders, and front-line soldiers, acting in real time with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy. that’s why we will also expand authority for american armed forces to target the terrorists and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout afghanistan. these killers need to know they have nowhere to hide, that no place is beyond the reach of american might and american arms. retribution will be fast and powerful, as we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field. we’re already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat isis, including the liberation of mosul in iraq. since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard. we will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror. when america commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive and overwhelming force. our troops will fight to win. we will fight to win. from now on, victory will have a clear definition. attacking our enemies, obliterating isis, crushing al qaeda, preventing the taliban from taking over afghanistan and stopping mass terror attacks against america before they emerge. we will ask our nato allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own. we are confident they will. since taking office, i have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense. and they have done so. in this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of afghanistan and their courageous armed forces. as the prime minister of afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us. afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us. the stronger the afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do. afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future. we want them to succeed. but we will no longer use american military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. those days are now over. instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests. we are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives. this principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward. military power alone will not bring peace to afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country. but strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace. america will work with the afghan government as long as we see determination and progress. however, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check. the government of afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden. the american people expect to see real reforms, real progress and real results. our patience is not unlimited. we will keep our eyes open. in abiding by the oath i took on jan. 20, i will remain steadfast in protecting american lives and american interests. in this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat. terrorists take heed: america will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military, and this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. in every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed. we prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for. not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of america’s greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at arlington national cemetery. there’s more courage, sacrifice and love in those hallowed grounds than at any other spot on the face of the earth. many of those who have fought and died in afghanistan enlisted in the months after sept. 11, 2001. they volunteered for a simple reason: they loved america, and they were determined to protect her. now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives. we must unite to defend america from its enemies abroad. we must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home. and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid. our actions, and in months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation. with our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace. we will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you. thank you. may god bless our military, and may god bless the united states of america. thank you very much. thank you."

   "text": "we.re here today to discuss matters of vital importance to us all: america.s security, prosperity, and standing in the world. i want to talk about where we.ve been, where we are now, and, finally, our strategy for where we are going in the years ahead. over the past 11 months, i have travelled tens of thousands of miles to visit 13 countries. i have met with more than 100 world leaders. i have carried america.s message to a grand hall in saudi arabia, a great square in warsaw, to the general assembly of the united nations, and to the seat of democracy on the korean peninsula. everywhere i travelled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honour to represent the american people. throughout our history, the american people have always been the true source of american greatness. our people have promoted our culture and promoted our values. americans have fought and sacrificed on the battlefields all over the world. we have liberated captive nations, transformed former enemies into the best of friends, and lifted entire regions of the planet from poverty to prosperity. because of our people, america has been among the greatest forces for peace and justice in the history of the world. the american people are generous. you are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. when the american people speak, all of us should listen. and just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. on november 8, 2016, you voted to make america great again. you embraced new leadership and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope. that is why we are here today. but to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. for many years, our citizens watched as washington politicians presided over one disappointment after another. too many of our leaders - so many who forgot whose voices they were to respect and whose interests they were supposed to defend - our leaders in washington negotiated disastrous trade deals that brought massive profits to many foreign nations, but sent thousands of american factories, and millions of american jobs, to those other countries. read more in new security plan, trump hits out at russia, china our leaders engaged in nation-building abroad, while they failed to build up and replenish our nation at home. they undercut and shortchanged our men and women in uniform with inadequate resources, unstable funding, and unclear missions. they failed to insist that our often very wealthy allies pay their fair share for defence, putting a massive and unfair burden on the us taxpayer and our great us military. they neglected a nuclear menace in north korea; made a disastrous, weak, and incomprehensibly bad deal with iran; and allowed terrorists such as isis (islamic state of iraq and the levant) to gain control of vast parts of territory all across the middle east. they put american energy under lock and key. they imposed punishing regulations and crippling taxes. they surrendered our sovereignty to foreign bureaucrats in faraway and distant capitals. and over the profound objections of the american people, our politicians left our borders wide open. millions of immigrants entered illegally. millions more were admitted into our country without the proper vetting needed to protect our security and our economy. leaders in washington imposed on the country an immigration policy that americans never voted for, never asked for, and never approved - a policy where the wrong people are allowed into our country and the right people are rejected. american citizens, as usual, have been left to bear the cost and to pick up the tab. on top of everything else, our leaders drifted from american principles. they lost sight of america.s destiny. and they lost their belief in american greatness. as a result, our citizens lost something as well. the people lost confidence in their government and, eventually, even lost confidence in their future. but last year, all of that began to change. the american people rejected the failures of the past. you rediscovered your voice and reclaimed ownership of this nation and its destiny. on january 20th, 2017, i stood on the steps of the capitol to herald the day the people became the rulers of their nation again. thank you. now, less than one year later, i am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has already seen the signs. america is coming back, and america is coming back strong. upon my inauguration, i announced that the united states would return to a simple principle: the first duty of our government is to serve its citizens, many of whom have been forgotten. but they are not forgotten any more. with every decision and every action, we are now putting america first. we are rebuilding our nation, our confidence, and our standing in the world. we have moved swiftly to confront our challenges, and we have confronted them head-on. we are once again investing in our defence - almost $700bn, a record, this coming year. we are demanding extraordinary strength, which will hopefully lead to long and extraordinary peace. we are giving our courageous military men and women the support they need and so dearly deserve. we have withdrawn the united states from job-killing deals such as the trans-pacific partnership and the very expensive and unfair paris climate accord. and on our trip to asia last month, i announced that we will no longer tolerate trading abuse. we have established strict new vetting procedures to keep terrorists out of the united states, and our vetting is getting tougher each month. to counter iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, i sanctioned the islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support of terrorism, and i declined to certify the iran deal to congress. following my trip to the middle east, the gulf states and other muslim-majority nations joined together to fight radical islamist ideology and terrorist financing. we have dealt isis one devastating defeat after another. the coalition to defeat isis has now recaptured almost 100 percent of the land once held by these terrorists in iraq and syria. great job. great job. really good. thank you. thank you. we have a great military. we.re now chasing them wherever they flee, and we will not let them into the united states. in afghanistan, our troops are no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies of our plans. we are beginning to see results on the battlefield. and we have made clear to pakistan that while we desire continued partnership, we must see decisive action against terrorist groups operating on their territory. and we make massive payments every year to pakistan. they have to help. our efforts to strengthen the nato alliance set the stage for significant increases in member contributions, with tens of billions of dollars more pouring in because i would not allow member states to be delinquent in the payment while we guarantee their safety and are willing to fight wars for them. we have made clear that countries that are immensely wealthy should reimburse the united states for the cost of defending them. this is a major departure from the past, but a fair and necessary one - necessary for our country, necessary for our taxpayer, necessary for our own thought process. our campaign of maximum pressure on the north korean regime has resulted in the toughest-ever sanctions. we have united our allies in an unprecedented effort to isolate north korea. however, there is much more work to do. america and its allies will take all necessary steps to achieve a denuclearisation and ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world. thank you. this situation should have been taken care of long before i got into office, when it was much easier to handle. but it will be taken care of. we have no choice. at home, we are keeping our promises and liberating the american economy. we have created more than two million jobs since the election. unemployment is at a 17-year low. the stock market is at an all-time high and, just a little while ago, hit yet another all-time high - the 85th time since my election. we have cut 22 regulations for every one new regulation, the most in the history of our country. we have unlocked america.s vast energy resources. as the world watches - and the world is indeed watching - we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for american families and businesses. it will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country. thank you. thank you. thank you. watch: us national security: trump set to make key policy speech (2:41) and we are seeing the response we fully expected. economic growth has topped three percent for two quarters in a row. gdp growth, which is way ahead of schedule under my administration, will be one of america.s truly greatest weapons. optimism has surged. confidence has returned. with this new confidence, we are also bringing back clarity to our thinking. we are reasserting these fundamental truths: a nation without borders is not a nation. a nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot protect its interests abroad. a nation that is not prepared to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. a nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident in its future. and a nation that is not certain of its values cannot summon the will to defend them. today, grounded in these truths, we are presenting to the world our new national security strategy. based on my direction, this document has been in development for over a year. it has the endorsement of my entire cabinet. our new strategy is based on a principled realism, guided by our vital national interests, and rooted in our timeless values. this strategy recognises that, whether we like it or not, we are engaged in a new era of competition. we accept that vigorous military, economic, and political contests are now playing out all around the world. we face rogue regimes that threaten the united states and our allies. we face terrorist organisations, transnational criminal networks, and others who spread violence and evil around the globe. we also face rival powers, russia and china, that seek to challenge american influence, values, and wealth. we will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest. as an example, yesterday i received a call from president putin of russia thanking our country for the intelligence that our cia was able to provide them concerning a major terrorist attack planned in st petersburg, where many people, perhaps in the thousands, could have been killed. they were able to apprehend these terrorists before the event, with no loss of life. and that.s a great thing, and the way it.s supposed to work. that is the way it.s supposed to work. but while we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves, and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before. thank you. thank you. thank you. we know that american success is not a foregone conclusion. it must be earned and it must be won. our rivals are tough, they.re tenacious, and committed to the long term. but so are we. to succeed, we must integrate every dimension of our national strength, and we must compete with every instrument of our national power. under the trump administration, america is gaining wealth, leading to enhanced power -- faster than anyone thought - with $6 trillion more in the stock market alone since the election -- $6 trillion. with the strategy i am announcing today, we are declaring that america is in the game and america is going to win. thank you. our strategy advances four vital national interests. first, we must protect the american people, the homeland, and our great american way of life. this strategy recognises that we cannot secure our nation if we do not secure our borders. so for the first time ever, american strategy now includes a serious plan to defend our homeland. it calls for the construction of a wall on our southern border; ending chain migration and the horrible visa and lottery programs; closing loopholes that undermine enforcement; and strongly supporting our border patrol agents, ice officers, and homeland security personnel. in addition, our strategy calls for us to confront, discredit, and defeat radical islamic terrorism and ideology and to prevent it from spreading into the united states. and we will develop new ways to counter those who use new domains, such as cyber and social media, to attack our nation or threaten our society. the second pillar of our strategy is to promote american prosperity. for the first time, american strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for american power and influence abroad. any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both. that is why this national security strategy emphasises, more than any before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our nation for a long, long time to come. it calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. it calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. it calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. and it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base. the strategy proposes a complete rebuilding of american infrastructure - our roads, bridges, airports, waterways, and communications infrastructure. and it embraces a future of american energy dominance and self-sufficiency. the third pillar of our strategy is to preserve peace through strength. we recognise that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unrivalled power is the most certain means of defence. for this reason, our strategy breaks from the damaging defence sequester. we.re going to get rid of that. it calls for a total modernisation of our military, and reversing previous decisions to shrink our armed forces - even as threats to national security grew. it calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs. this strategy includes plans to counter modern threats, such as cyber and electromagnetic attacks. it recognises space as a competitive domain and calls for multi-layered missile defence. this strategy outlines important steps to address new forms of conflict such as economic and political aggression. and our strategy emphasises strengthening alliances to cope with these threats. it recognises that our strength is magnified by allies who share principles - and our principles - and shoulder their fair share of responsibility for our common security. fourth and finally, our strategy is to advance american influence in the world, but this begins with building up our wealth and power at home. america will lead again. we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but we will champion the values without apology. we want strong alliances and partnerships based on cooperation and reciprocity. we will make new partnerships with those who share our goals, and make common interests into a common cause. we will not allow inflexible ideology to become an obsolete and obstacle to peace. we will pursue the vision we have carried around the world over this past year - a vision of strong, sovereign, and independent nations that respect their citizens and respect their neighbours; nations that thrive in commerce and cooperation, rooted in their histories and branching out toward their destinies. that is the future we wish for this world, and that is the future we seek in america. with this strategy, we are calling for a great reawakening of america, a resurgence of confidence, and a rebirth of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. and we are returning to the wisdom of our founders. in america, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. what we have built here in america is precious and unique. in all of history, never before has freedom reigned, the rule of law prevailed, and the people thrived as we have here for nearly 250 years. we must love and defend it. we must guard it with vigilance and spirit, and, if necessary, like so many before us, with our very lives. and we declare that our will is renewed, our future is regained, and our dreams are restored. every american has a role to play in this grand national effort. and today, i invite every citizen to take their part in our vital mission. together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate american greatness as a shining example to the world. as long as we are proud - and very proud - of who we are, how we got here, and what we are fighting for to preserve, we will not fail. if we do all of this, if we rediscover our resolve and commit ourselves to compete and win again, then together we will leave our children and our grandchildren a nation that is stronger, better, freer, prouder, and, yes, an america that is greater than ever before. god bless you. thank you very much. thank you."

   "text": "thank you very much. that.s so nice. the united states has many great diplomats, but there is truly no better ambassador for our country than our beautiful first lady, melania. thank you, melania. that was very nice. (applause.) we.ve come to your nation to deliver a very important message: america loves poland, and america loves the polish people. (applause.) thank you. the poles have not only greatly enriched this region, but polish-americans have also greatly enriched the united states, and i was truly proud to have their support in the 2016 election. (applause.) it is a profound honor to stand in this city, by this monument to the warsaw uprising, and to address the polish nation that so many generations have dreamed of: a poland that is safe, strong, and free. (applause.) president duda and your wonderful first lady, agata, have welcomed us with the tremendous warmth and kindness for which poland is known around the world. thank you. (applause.) my sincere -- and i mean sincerely thank both of them. and to prime minister syzdlo, a very special thanks also. (applause.) we are also pleased that former president leck walesa, so famous for leading the solidarity movement, has joined us today, also. (applause.) thank you. thank you. thank you. on behalf of all americans, let me also thank the entire polish people for the generosity you have shown in welcoming our soldiers to your country. these soldiers are not only brave defenders of freedom, but also symbols of america.s commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic europe. we are proudly joined on stage by american, polish, british, and romanian soldiers. thank you. (applause.) thank you. great job. president duda and i have just come from an incredibly successful meeting with the leaders participating in the three seas initiative. to the citizens of this great region, america is eager to expand our partnership with you. we welcome stronger ties of trade and commerce as you grow your economies. and we are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy. (applause.) mr. president, i congratulate you, along with the president of croatia, on your leadership of this historic three seas initiative. thank you. (applause.) president trump visits poland, germany photos: trump at g20 summit this is my first visit to central europe as president, and i am thrilled that it could be right here at this magnificent, beautiful piece of land. it is beautiful. (applause.) poland is the geographic heart of europe, but more importantly, in the polish people, we see the soul of europe. your nation is great because your spirit is great and your spirit is strong. (applause.) for two centuries, poland suffered constant and brutal attacks. but while poland could be invaded and occupied, and its borders even erased from the map, it could never be erased from history or from your hearts. in those dark days, you have lost your land but you never lost your pride. (applause.) so it is with true admiration that i can say today, that from the farms and villages of your countryside to the cathedrals and squares of your great cities, poland lives, poland prospers, and poland prevails. (applause.) despite every effort to transform you, oppress you, or destroy you, you endured and overcame. you are the proud nation of copernicus -- think of that -- (applause) -- chopin, saint john paul ii. poland is a land of great heroes. (applause.) and you are a people who know the true value of what you defend. the triumph of the polish spirit over centuries of hardship gives us all hope for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war. for americans, poland has been a symbol of hope since the beginning of our nation. polish heroes and american patriots fought side by side in our war of independence and in many wars that followed. our soldiers still serve together today in afghanistan and iraq, combatting the enemies of all civilization. for america.s part, we have never given up on freedom and independence as the right and destiny of the polish people, and we never, ever will. (applause.) our two countries share a special bond forged by unique histories and national characters. it.s a fellowship that exists only among people who have fought and bled and died for freedom. (applause.) the signs of this friendship stand in our nation.s capital. just steps from the white house, we.ve raised statues of men with names like pułaski and kościuszko. (applause.) the same is true in warsaw, where street signs carry the name of george washington, and a monument stands to one of the world.s greatest heroes, ronald reagan. (applause.) and so i am here today not just to visit an old ally, but to hold it up as an example for others who seek freedom and who wish to summon the courage and the will to defend our civilization. (applause.) the story of poland is the story of a people who have never lost hope, who have never been broken, and who have never, ever forgotten who they are. (applause) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: thank you. thank you so much. thank you. thank you so much. such a great honor. this is a nation more than one thousand years old. your borders were erased for more than a century and only restored just one century ago. in 1920, in the miracle of vistula, poland stopped the soviet army bent on european conquest. (applause.) then, 19 years later in 1939, you were invaded yet again, this time by nazi germany from the west and the soviet union from the east. that.s trouble. that.s tough. under a double occupation the polish people endured evils beyond description: the katyn forest massacre, the occupations, the holocaust, the warsaw ghetto and the warsaw ghetto uprising, the destruction of this beautiful capital city, and the deaths of nearly one in five polish people. a vibrant jewish population -- the largest in europe -- was reduced to almost nothing after the nazis systematically murdered millions of poland.s jewish citizens, along with countless others, during that brutal occupation. in the summer of 1944, the nazi and soviet armies were preparing for a terrible and bloody battle right here in warsaw. amid that hell on earth, the citizens of poland rose up to defend their homeland. i am deeply honored to be joined on stage today by veterans and heroes of the warsaw uprising. (applause.) audience: (chanting.) president trump: what great spirit. we salute your noble sacrifice and we pledge to always remember your fight for poland and for freedom. thank you. thank you. (applause.) this monument reminds us that more than 150,000 poles died during that desperate struggle to overthrow oppression. from the other side of the river, the soviet armed forces stopped and waited. they watched as the nazis ruthlessly destroyed the city, viciously murdering men, women, and children. they tried to destroy this nation forever by shattering its will to survive. trump says election meddling .could be russia. but .no one really knows for sure. trump says election meddling .could be russia. but .no one really knows for sure. but there is a courage and a strength deep in the polish character that no one could destroy. the polish martyr, bishop michael kozal, said it well: .more horrifying than a defeat of arms is a collapse of the human spirit.. through four decades of communist rule, poland and the other captive nations of europe endured a brutal campaign to demolish freedom, your faith, your laws, your history, your identity -- indeed the very essence of your culture and your humanity. yet, through it all, you never lost that spirit. (applause.) your oppressors tried to break you, but poland could not be broken. (applause.) and when the day came on june 2nd, 1979, and one million poles gathered around victory square for their very first mass with their polish pope, that day, every communist in warsaw must have known that their oppressive system would soon come crashing down. (applause.) they must have known it at the exact moment during pope john paul ii.s sermon when a million polish men, women, and children suddenly raised their voices in a single prayer. a million polish people did not ask for wealth. they did not ask for privilege. instead, one million poles sang three simple words: .we want god.. (applause.) in those words, the polish people recalled the promise of a better future. they found new courage to face down their oppressors, and they found the words to declare that poland would be poland once again. as i stand here today before this incredible crowd, this faithful nation, we can still hear those voices that echo through history. their message is as true today as ever. the people of poland, the people of america, and the people of europe still cry out .we want god.. (applause.) together, with pope john paul ii, the poles reasserted their identity as a nation devoted to god. and with that powerful declaration of who you are, you came to understand what to do and how to live. you stood in solidarity against oppression, against a lawless secret police, against a cruel and wicked system that impoverished your cities and your souls. and you won. poland prevailed. poland will always prevail. (applause.) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: thank you. you were supported in that victory over communism by a strong alliance of free nations in the west that defied tyranny. now, among the most committed members of the nato alliance, poland has resumed its place as a leading nation of a europe that is strong, whole, and free. a strong poland is a blessing to the nations of europe, and they know that. a strong europe is a blessing to the west and to the world. (applause.) one hundred years after the entry of american forces into world war i, the transatlantic bond between the united states and europe is as strong as ever and maybe, in many ways, even stronger. this continent no longer confronts the specter of communism. but today we.re in the west, and we have to say there are dire threats to our security and to our way of life. you see what.s happening out there. they are threats. we will confront them. we will win. but they are threats. (applause.) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: we are confronted by another oppressive ideology -- one that seeks to export terrorism and extremism all around the globe. america and europe have suffered one terror attack after another. we.re going to get it to stop. (applause.) during a historic gathering in saudi arabia, i called on the leaders of more than 50 muslim nations to join together to drive out this menace which threatens all of humanity. we must stand united against these shared enemies to strip them of their territory and their funding, and their networks, and any form of ideological support that they may have. while we will always welcome new citizens who share our values and love our people, our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind. (applause.) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: we are fighting hard against radical islamic terrorism, and we will prevail. we cannot accept those who reject our values and who use hatred to justify violence against the innocent. cnn.s chris cillizza cuts through the political spin and tells you what you need to know. by subscribing, you agree to our privacy policy. enter email address today, the west is also confronted by the powers that seek to test our will, undermine our confidence, and challenge our interests. to meet new forms of aggression, including propaganda, financial crimes, and cyberwarfare, we must adapt our alliance to compete effectively in new ways and on all new battlefields. we urge russia to cease its destabilizing activities in ukraine and elsewhere, and its support for hostile regimes -- including syria and iran -- and to instead join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defense of civilization itself. (applause.) finally, on both sides of the atlantic, our citizens are confronted by yet another danger -- one firmly within our control. this danger is invisible to some but familiar to the poles: the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people. the west became great not because of paperwork and regulations but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies. americans, poles, and the nations of europe value individual freedom and sovereignty. we must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the south or the east, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are. (applause.) if left unchecked, these forces will undermine our courage, sap our spirit, and weaken our will to defend ourselves and our societies. but just as our adversaries and enemies of the past learned here in poland, we know that these forces, too, are doomed to fail if we want them to fail. and we do, indeed, want them to fail. (applause.) they are doomed not only because our alliance is strong, our countries are resilient, and our power is unmatched. through all of that, you have to say everything is true. our adversaries, however, are doomed because we will never forget who we are. and if we don.t forget who are, we just can.t be beaten. americans will never forget. the nations of europe will never forget. we are the fastest and the greatest community. there is nothing like our community of nations. the world has never known anything like our community of nations. we write symphonies. we pursue innovation. we celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. we reward brilliance. we strive for excellence, and cherish inspiring works of art that honor god. we treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression. (applause.) we empower women as pillars of our society and of our success. we put faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, at the center of our lives. and we debate everything. we challenge everything. we seek to know everything so that we can better know ourselves. (applause.) and above all, we value the dignity of every human life, protect the rights of every person, and share the hope of every soul to live in freedom. that is who we are. those are the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization. what we have, what we inherited from our -- and you know this better than anybody, and you see it today with this incredible group of people -- what we.ve inherited from our ancestors has never existed to this extent before. and if we fail to preserve it, it will never, ever exist again. so we cannot fail. this great community of nations has something else in common: in every one of them, it is the people, not the powerful, who have always formed the foundation of freedom and the cornerstone of our defense. the people have been that foundation here in poland -- as they were right here in warsaw -- and they were the foundation from the very, very beginning in america. our citizens did not win freedom together, did not survive horrors together, did not face down evil together, only to lose our freedom to a lack of pride and confidence in our values. we did not and we will not. we will never back down. (applause.) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: as long as we know our history, we will know how to build our future. americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our interests. that is why my administration has demanded that all members of nato finally meet their full and fair financial obligation. as a result of this insistence, billions of dollars more have begun to pour into nato. in fact, people are shocked. but billions and billions of dollars more are coming in from countries that, in my opinion, would not have been paying so quickly. to those who would criticize our tough stance, i would point out that the united states has demonstrated not merely with words but with its actions that we stand firmly behind article 5, the mutual defense commitment. (applause.) words are easy, but actions are what matters. and for its own protection -- and you know this, everybody knows this, everybody has to know this -- europe must do more. europe must demonstrate that it believes in its future by investing its money to secure that future. that is why we applaud poland for its decision to move forward this week on acquiring from the united states the battle-tested patriot air and missile defense system -- the best anywhere in the world. (applause.) that is also why we salute the polish people for being one of the nato countries that has actually achieved the benchmark for investment in our common defense. thank you. thank you, poland. i must tell you, the example you set is truly magnificent, and we applaud poland. thank you. (applause.) we have to remember that our defense is not just a commitment of money, it is a commitment of will. because as the polish experience reminds us, the defense of the west ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have. the fundamental question of our time is whether the west has the will to survive. do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it? (applause.) we can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive. (applause.) if anyone forgets the critical importance of these things, let them come to one country that never has. let them come to poland. (applause.) and let them come here, to warsaw, and learn the story of the warsaw uprising. donald trump just defined what being .modern day presidential. president looks like donald trump just defined what being .modern day presidential. president looks like when they do, they should learn about jerusalem avenue. in august of 1944, jerusalem avenue was one of the main roads running east and west through this city, just as it is today. control of that road was crucially important to both sides in the battle for warsaw. the german military wanted it as their most direct route to move troops and to form a very strong front. and for the polish home army, the ability to pass north and south across that street was critical to keep the center of the city, and the uprising itself, from being split apart and destroyed. every night, the poles put up sandbags amid machine gun fire -- and it was horrendous fire -- to protect a narrow passage across jerusalem avenue. every day, the enemy forces knocked them down again and again and again. then the poles dug a trench. finally, they built a barricade. and the brave polish fighters began to flow across jerusalem avenue. that narrow passageway, just a few feet wide, was the fragile link that kept the uprising alive. between its walls, a constant stream of citizens and freedom fighters made their perilous, just perilous, sprints. they ran across that street, they ran through that street, they ran under that street -- all to defend this city. .the far side was several yards away,. recalled one young polish woman named greta. that mortality and that life was so important to her. in fact, she said, .the mortally dangerous sector of the street was soaked in the blood. it was the blood of messengers, liaison girls, and couriers.. nazi snipers shot at anybody who crossed. anybody who crossed, they were being shot at. their soldiers burned every building on the street, and they used the poles as human shields for their tanks in their effort to capture jerusalem avenue. the enemy never ceased its relentless assault on that small outpost of civilization. and the poles never ceased its defense. the jerusalem avenue passage required constant protection, repair, and reinforcement, but the will of its defenders did not waver, even in the face of death. and to the last days of the uprising, the fragile crossing never, ever failed. it was never, ever forgotten. it was kept open by the polish people. the memories of those who perished in the warsaw uprising cry out across the decades, and few are clearer than the memories of those who died to build and defend the jerusalem avenue crossing. those heroes remind us that the west was saved with the blood of patriots; that each generation must rise up and play their part in its defense -- (applause) -- and that every foot of ground, and every last inch of civilization, is worth defending with your life. our own fight for the west does not begin on the battlefield -- it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls. today, the ties that unite our civilization are no less vital, and demand no less defense, than that bare shred of land on which the hope of poland once totally rested. our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory. and today as ever, poland is in our heart, and its people are in that fight. (applause.) just as poland could not be broken, i declare today for the world to hear that the west will never, ever be broken. our values will prevail. our people will thrive. and our civilization will triumph. (applause.) audience: donald trump! donald trump! donald trump! president trump: thank you. so, together, let us all fight like the poles -- for family, for freedom, for country, and for god. thank you. god bless you. god bless the polish people. god bless our allies. and god bless the united states of america. thank you. god bless you. thank you very much. (applause.)"

   "text": "chief justice roberts, president carter, president clinton, president bush, president obama, fellow americans and people of the world, thank you. (applause) we, the citizens of america, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. (applause) together, we will determine the course of america and the world for many, many years to come. we will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done. every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. they have been magnificent. thank you. (applause) today.s ceremony, however, has very special meaning because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from washington, d.c. and giving it back to you, the people. (applause) for too long, a small group in our nation.s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. their victories have not been your victories. their triumphs have not been your triumphs. and while they celebrated in our nation.s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. (applause) that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you. (applause) it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america. this is your day. this is your celebration. and this, the united states of america, is your country. (applause) what truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. (applause) january 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. (applause) the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. (applause) everyone is listening to you now. you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. (applause) at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens. americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. these are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. this american carnage stops right here and stops right now. (applause) we are one nation and their pain is our pain. their dreams are our dreams. and their success will be our success. we share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans. (applause) for many decades, we.ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry; subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. we.ve defended other nations. borders while refusing to defend our own. (applause) and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while america.s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. we.ve made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. one by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of american workers that were left behind. the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. but that is the past. and now, we are looking only to the future. (applause) we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. from this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. from this day forward, it.s going to be only america first, america first. (applause) every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families. we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. (applause) protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. i will fight for you with every breath in my body and i will never ever let you down. (applause) america will start winning again, winning like never before. (applause) we will bring back our jobs. we will bring back our borders. we will bring back our wealth. and we will bring back our dreams. (applause) we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation. we will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor. (applause) we will follow two simple rules; buy american and hire american. (applause) we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example. we will shine for everyone to follow. (applause) we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth. (applause) at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

(applause) do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america. we will not fail. our country will thrive and prosper again. we stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. a new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. it.s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. (applause) we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag. (applause) and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the wind-swept plains of nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator. (applause) so to all americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again. (applause) your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our american destiny. and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. together, we will make america strong again. we will make america wealthy again. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again. and yes, together we will make america great again.

   "text": "thank you, melania for your moving words and deep devotion. i can tell you to our nation and children. thank you all to members of congress, my cabinet, governors, members of congress, state, local leaders, first responders and health care professionals gathered here today. we have some truly incredible people in this room that i can tell you. most importantly, we acknowledge the families present who have lost a cherished loved one. as you all know from personal experience, families, communities and citizens across our country are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in american history. and even, if you really think about it, world history. this is all throughout the world. the fact is this is a world-wide problem. this crisis of drug use, addiction, and overdose deaths in many years, it.s just been so long in the making, addressing it will require all of our effort and require us to confront the crisis in all of its very real complexity. last year we lost at least 64,000 americans to overdoses. that.s 175 lost american lives per day. that.s seven lost lives per hour in our country. drug overdoses are now the leading cause of unintentionally death in the united states by far. more people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined. think of it, motor vehicle crashes, gun homicides, more people by far from drug overdoses. these overdoses are driven by a massive increase in addiction. to prescription pain killers, heroin, and other opioids. last year almost one million americans used heroin. and more than 11 million abused prescription opioids. the united states is by far the largest consumer of these drugs using more opioid pills per person than any other country by far in the world. opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999, and now account for the majority of fatal drug overdoses. who would have thought. no part of our society, not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural, has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that.s taking place with opioids. in west virginia, a truly great state, great people, there is a hospital nursery where one in every five babies spends its first days in agony because these precious babies were exposed to opioids or other drugs in the womb, they endure nausea, pain, anxiety, sleeplessness, and have trouble eating, just as the same adults under going detox. some of these children will likely lose one or both of their parents to drug addiction and overdose. they will join the growing ranks of america.s opioid orphans. such beautiful, beautiful babies. beyond the shocking death toll, the terrible measure of the opioid crisis includes the families ripped a part, and for many communities, a generation of lost potential and opportunity. this epidemic is a national health emergency. unlike many of us, we have seen and what we have seen in our lifetimes, nobody has seen anything like what.s going on now. as americans, we cannot allow this to continue. it is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. it.s never been this way. we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic. we can do it. we can do it. that is why effective today my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law. and why i am directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate emergency authority to fight the opioid crisis. this marks a critical step in confronting the extraordinary challenge that we face. as part of this emergency response, we will announce a new policy to overcome a restrictive 1970s-era rule that prevents states from providing care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds for those suffering from drug addiction. a number of states have reached out to us asking for relief, and you should expect to see approvals that will unlock treatment for people in need and those approvals will come very, very fast, not like in the past, very, very quickly. ending the epidemic will require mobilization of government, local communities and organizations. it will require the resolve of our entire company. advertisement - continue reading below the scale of this crisis of addiction is why soon after coming into office i convened a presidential commission headed by governor chris christie that has consulted with experts across america to listen, to learn, and report back on potential solutions. we await the final report which will come in next week. and i know some of the report has already been seen, because i want to see it as quickly as possible, and some of the things that they are recommending are common sense, but very, very important. and they are going to have a tremendous impact, believe me, tremendous impact. today i.ll detail many of these aggressive steps with my administration which we.ve already taken. after we review and evaluate the commission.s findings, i.ll quickly move to implement approximate and appropriate recommendations. but i want the american people to know the federal government is aggressively fighting the opioid epidemic on all fronts. we are working with doctors and medical professionals to implement best practices for safe opioid prescribing. and we will do something very, very special. we are requiring federally employed prescribers to receive finally special training. the centers for disease control and prevention has launched a prescription awareness campaign to put faces on the danger of opioid abuse. i want to acknowledge cvs caremark for announcing last month that it will limit first-time opioid prescription among seven day supplies, and i encourage others to help stop this epidemic to do their part. the fda is now requiring drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids to provide more training to prescribers and to help prevent abuse and addiction and has requested that one especially high risk opioid be withdrawn from the market immediately. we are requiring that a specific opioid, which is truly evil, be taken off the market immediately. the u.s. postal service and the department of homeland security are strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl a synthetic opioid manufactured in china and 50 times stronger than heroin. and in two weeks i will be in china with president xi and i.ll mention this as a top priority. and he will do something about it. i am also pleased to report that for the first time the department of justice has indicated major chinese drug traffickers, and they have really put very, very strong clamps on them. they have indicted them. the drug traffickers for distributing fentanyl into the united states. so jeff, thank you very much. good job, good job. and they have been indicted and we are not going to forget about them, believe me, they are doing tremendous harm to our country. the justice department is aggressively and really valiantly pursuing those who illegally prescribe and traffic in opioids both in our communities and on the internet. and i.ll be looking at the potential of the federal government bringing major lawsuits against bad actors, what they have, and what they are doing to our people is unheard of. we will be bringing some very major lawsuits against people and against companies that are hurting our people. and that will start taking place pretty soon. we are also supporting first responders and medical professionals access to the tools they need to prevent deaths through life-saving overdose medications. at my direction, the national institute of health headed up by francis collins has taken the first steps of an ambitious public-private partnership with pharmaceutical companies to develop non-addictive pain killers and new treatments for addiction and overdose. advertisement - continue reading below so important. i.ll be pushing the concept of non-addictive pain killers very, very hard. we have to come up with that solution. we give away billions and billions of dollars a year, and we.re going to be spending lots of money on coming up with a non-addictive solution. we will be asking dr. collins and the nih for substantial resources in the fight against drug addiction. one of the things our administration will be doing is a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place, because they will see the devastation and the ruination it causes to people and people.s lives. watch what happens if we do our jobs, how the number of drug users and the addicted will start to tumble downward over a period of years. it will be a beautiful thing to see. i learned myself, i had a brother fred, great guy, best looking guy, best personality, much better than mine, but he had a problem. he had a problem with alcohol. and he would tell me don.t drink. don.t drink. he was substantially older, and i listened to him and respected. but i would constantly tell me don.t drink. he would also add don.t smoke. but he would say it over and over and over again. and to this day i.ve never had a drink. and i have no longing for it. i have no interest in it. to this day i.ve never had a cigarette. don.t worry, those are only two of my good things. i don.t want to tell you about the bad things. there are plenty of bad things too. but he really helped me. i had somebody that guided me. and he had a very, very, very tough life because of alcohol, believe me, very, very tough life. he was a strong guy, but it was a tough, tough thing that he was going through. but i learned because of fred, i learned. and that.s what i think is so important. this was an idea that i had where if we can teach young people not to take drugs, just not to take them. when i see friends of mine that are having difficulty with not having that drink at dinner, where it.s literally almost impossible for them to stop, i say to myself, i can.t even understand it, why would that be difficult? but we understand why it is difficult. the fact is if we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it.s really, really easy not to take them. and i think that.s going to end up being our most important thing. really tough, really big, really great advertising. so we get to people before they start so they don.t have to go through the problems of what people are going through. we are already distributing nearly $1 billion in grants for addiction prevention and treatment. and over $50 million to support law enforcement programs that assist those facing prison and facing addiction. we have also launched an $81 million partnership to research better pain management techniques for our incredible veterans. and, by the way, secretary shulkin is here, you have done an incredible job for our veterans in a very short period. and soon hhs will launch a task force to develop an update for pain management across the federal government. i am urging all americans to help fight this opioid epidemic. and the broader issue of drug addiction by participating in the national drug take back day this saturday. when you can safely turn in these dangerous and horrible drugs for disposal, that will be a wonderful, wonderful period of time for you. all of these actions are important parts of my administration.s larger effort to confront the drug addiction crisis in america and confront it head on. straight on. strong. we are going to do it. we are going to do it. for too long we have allowed drugs to ravage american homes, cities, and towns. we owe it to our children and to our country to do everything in our power to address this national shame and this human tragedy. we must stop the flow of all types of illegal drugs into our communities. advertisement - continue reading below for too long dangerous criminal cartels have been allowed to infiltrate and spread throughout our nation. an astonishing 90% comes from across the border which we are building a wall which will help in this problem. we.ll have a great impact. my administration is dedicated to enforcing our immigration laws, defending our maritime security, and securing our borders. we also have to work with other countries to stop these drugs where they originate. we have no choice. we have to work with others. we have to get together. because they have similar problems to what we have. some countries have bigger problems than we have. whether that country is china, whether it.s a country in latin america, it makes no difference. we are going to be working with all of them. we are taking the fight directly to the criminals in places that they are producing this poison. here in america we are once again enforcing the law, breaking up gangs, and distribution networks, and arresting criminals who pedal dangerous drugs to our youth. in addition, we understand the need to confront reality right smack in the face that millions of our fellow citizens are already addicted. that.s the reality. we want them to get help they need. we have no choice but to help these people that are hooked and are suffering so they can recover and rebuild their lives with their families. we are committed to pursuing innovative approaches that have been proven to work, like drug courts. our efforts will be based on sound metrics and guided by evidence and guided by results. this includes making addiction treatment available to those in prison and to help them eventually reenter society as productive and law-abiding citizens. finally, we must adopt the most common sense solution of all to prevent our citizens from becoming addicted to drugs in the first place. we must and are focusing so much of our effort on drug-demand reduction. we must confront the culture of drug abuse head on to reduce the demand for dangerous narcotics. every person who buys illicit drugs in america should know they are risking their future, their families, and even their lives. and every american should know that if they purchase illegal drugs, they are helping to finance some of the most violent, cruel, and ruthless organizations anywhere in the world. illegal drug use is not a victimless crime. there is nothing admirable, positive, or socially desirable about it. there is nothing desirable about drugs. they are bad. we want the next generation of young americans to know the blessings of a drug-free life. in this enormous struggle against drug addiction and opioid epidemic, it really is that, it.s an epidemic, our greatest hope is the same that it.s always been, through every trial america has encountered throughout our history the spirit of our people we have won. each of us have a responsibility to this effort. we have a total responsibility to ourselves, to our family, to our country, including those who are struggling with this addiction. each of us is responsible to look out for our loved ones, our communities, our children, our neighbors, and our own health. almost every american has witnessed the horrors of addiction, whether it.s through their own struggle, or through the struggle of a friend, a coworker, a neighbor, or,frankly, a family member. our current addiction crisis, and especially the epidemic of opioid deaths will get worse before it gets better. but get better it will. it will take many years and even decades to address this scourge in our society. but we must start in earnest now to combat national health emergency. we are inspired by the stories of every day heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair, through leadership and through love. advertisement - continue reading below fire chief dan goonan of new hampshire, great state, runs a program, safe station, which allows drug dependent residents to seek help at fire stations at any time. jesse and cindi swafford of dayton, ohio have provided a loving, stable home to children affected by the opioid crisis. i am calling on every american to join the ranks of guardian angels like chief goonan and the swaffords who help life up the people of our great nation. together, we will care for our citizens, our children, and our orphans, and our, you know what i.m going to say, foster youth. so many, so many. but we are going to lift them up and take care of them. we will work to strengthen vulnerable families and communities, and we will help to build and grow a stronger, healthier, and drug-free society. together we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need. working together, we will defeat this opioid epidemic. it will be defeated. we will free our nation from the terrible affliction of drug abuse. and, yes, we will overcome addiction in america. we are going to overcome addiction in america. we have fought and won many battles and many wars before. and we will win again. thank you. god bless you. and god bless america. thank you."

   "text": "Thank you very much. You just want massive tax cuts. That \u0019s what you want. That \u0019s the only reason you \u0019re going so wild. (Applause.) But it \u0019s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana. What a place. (Applause.) I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative  Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. (Applause.) I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well. We appreciate it. (Applause.) Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane. I mean, their island was virtually destroyed. Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly. I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms. We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done. It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico. (Applause.) And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis. It \u0019s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that. And I \u0019m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected. And many of their policemen  \u0014 in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it \u0019s been a tough go. But we are  \u0014 we \u0019re going to get it back. Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county \u0019s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare. We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy. But with the rules of reconciliation, we \u0019re up against a deadline of Friday  \u0014 two days. That \u0019s just two days. And yes-vote senator  \u0014 we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator  \u0014 who is a yes vote, but he \u0019s home recovering from a pretty tough situation. And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent. It \u0019s going to be better managed for the people that it serves. Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C. Not even a contest. (Applause.) And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly. But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote. So we \u0019re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I \u0019d come in and sign. But it didn \u0019t work that way. There were a couple of people that  \u0014 I won \u0019t say anything. (Laughter.) But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we \u0019re going to have a vote. And we \u0019re going to be able to get that through, and I think we \u0019ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier. But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve. By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won \u0019t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one. And most of you know exactly what I \u0019m talking about. We \u0019re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People. (Applause.) This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it \u0019s probably something I can say that I \u0019m very good at. I \u0019ve been waiting for this for a long time. We \u0019re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country  \u0014 and most people thought left our country for good. (Applause.) We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American. (Applause.) It \u0019s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers. (Applause.) Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens. This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation  \u0014 and are we cutting regulation? (Applause.) And businesses all across the country have taken notice. In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states. Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed  \u0014 meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana. All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again. They chose, and their choice was so important. It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of  \u0014 (laughter)  \u0014 who signed the largest income tax cut in the state \u0019s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence. (Applause.) It \u0019s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana. We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them. That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office. That is what I talked about on the campaign trail. Already, we \u0019re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first. (Applause.) Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium. It \u0019s really a fantastic thing to see. (Applause.) Wages are rising. Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs. GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time. (Applause.) And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact. But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better. Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country. (Applause.) America is back on the right track. And I see so many red hats  \u0014 Make America Great Again. That \u0019s what we \u0019re doing  \u0014 Make America Great Again. (Applause.) But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America \u0019s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code. It \u0019s a relic. We \u0019ve got to change it. We have to compete  \u0014 compete with other countries. The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America \u0019s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it \u0019s ever been. But we \u0019re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally  \u0014 and want and deserve. For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform. Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families  \u0014 for the working man and woman  \u0014 and for businesses of all sizes. I look forward  \u0014 (Applause.) Thank you. I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people. These tax cuts are significant. There \u0019s never been tax cuts like what we \u0019re talking about. Our framework is based on four key ideas: First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans  \u0014 the people that work so long, so hard, and they \u0019ve been forgotten. But they \u0019re not forgotten anymore. I think we proved that on November 8th. (Applause.) Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 and a married couple won \u0019t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income. So, a married couple  \u0014 up to $24,000  \u0014 can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do. So much better. In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero. (Applause.) At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today. Where are they? Oh, hello, Jonathan. How are you? (Applause.) Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company. Together they \u0019re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000. Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more. And that \u0019s just on federal taxes. So they would have saved at least $1,000. Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for. (Applause.) We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families. Greatly expanded. We \u0019re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children. (Applause.) And this is just one more critical way that we \u0019re targeting relief to working families. In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved  \u0014 and we love these people, but we \u0019re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents  \u0014 will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit. (Applause.) We \u0019re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family. By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners. (Applause.) Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected. They can call me all they want. It \u0019s not going to help. I \u0019m doing the right thing, and it \u0019s not good for me. Believe me. (Applause.) But what is good for me  \u0014 not only as President and legacy  \u0014 what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years. That \u0019s good for me. That \u0019s good for everyone. (Applause.) And that \u0019s what I think is going to happen. (Applause.) And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me. In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. We \u0019ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people. Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally. (Applause.) Americans waste money. Americans waste so much money  \u0014 billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code. More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes. Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper. (Applause.) We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. About time. (Applause.) The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts. You \u0019re all familiar with it. Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with. We are making our taxes simple again. We are simplifying our tax system. To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax. (Applause.) That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you \u0019ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won \u0019t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax  \u0014 lose the business, ends up going out of business. All of those jobs are lost. The farmers in particular are affected. They have wonderful farms, but they can \u0019t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm. The people that buy it don \u0019t run it with love. They can \u0019t run it the same way, and it goes out. So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers. And we \u0019re getting rid of it. (Applause.) Now if you don \u0019t like your family, it won \u0019t matter, okay? (Laughter.) But for those that love your family, it matters a lot. (Laughter.) With us today is Kip Tom, a family farmer from Leesburg  \u0014 Where \u0019s Kip? Go ahead, Kip. Hi, Kip  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 who fears that his family \u0019s farming heritage  \u0014 it \u0019s been a long time. How long, Kip? A hundred and eighty-seven years  \u0014 that \u0019s peanuts, Kip. (Applause.) Wow. That \u0019s a long time. But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family. We \u0019re not going to let that happen. We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today. (Applause.) We will protect our farmers, our ranchers, and our small businesses, and we will make taxes simple, easy, and fair for all Americans. Okay? (Applause.) Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. (Applause.) In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers. Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations. And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways. They say they \u0019re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals. (Applause.) And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines  \u0014 Dakota Access. You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved. So we \u0019re letting that happen. But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more. And it was a beautiful sight to behold. Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did. And I shouldn \u0019t say even better because we didn \u0019t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out. And we \u0019re stopping that, and you see it right here what we \u0019ve done. Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world. That \u0019s not good. We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we \u0019re not surrendering anymore. We \u0019re not surrendering anymore. Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again. (Applause.) We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent. That \u0019s way down from 35 and 39  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations. This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven \u0019t seen in many years. (Applause.) When our companies move to other countries, it \u0019s our loyal American workers who get hurt. And when companies stay in America, and come to America, it \u0019s our wonderful workers who reap the rewards. And I just left the United Nations last week, and I was told by one of the most powerful leaders of the world that they \u0019re going to be announcing, in the not-too-distant future, five major factories in the United States  \u0014 between increasing and new  \u0014 five. (Applause.) You \u0019ll be hearing about that very soon. And I said thank you very much, and he said,  \u001cyou know what? It \u0019s starting to happen in the United States. It \u0019s starting to happen. \u001d So I just wanted to let you know that. I promised I wouldn \u0019t say who. I \u0019ll keep my word. Okay? (Laughter.) Unless you force me. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Who? THE PRESIDENT: Members of both parties  \u0014 it happens to be in the automobile industry. That \u0019s a good industry. (Laughter.) Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country. (Applause.) And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent  \u0014 much lower. Big difference. (Applause.) This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years. (Applause.) To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off  \u0014 listen to this  \u0014 the cost of equipment in the year they buy it. That is big. (Applause.) And that \u0019s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time. Now that \u0019s called incentive. That \u0019s called incentive. (Applause.) This will be tremendously important to help American businesses afford the heavy industrial machinery and other capital investments they need to grow big and grow strong. Joining us today is John Gannon, the owner of a custom wood fencing and deck construction company in Indianapolis. John is the father of nine children, and recently celebrated his 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations, John. (Applause.) And John is in the fencing company, as you heard, and I \u0019m just thinking  \u0014 I have to mention this  \u0014 you know, we have a fence around the White House. (Laughter.) We have a fence around the White House, and they want to build a new fence. And I figured, you know  \u0014 I \u0019m pretty good at construction  \u0014 I figured, I don \u0019t know, maybe a million, maybe a million-and-a-half. And this has been taking place over a long period of time  \u0014 previous administrations. So I said,  \u001chow much is the fence you \u0019re talking around the White House? \u001d  \u001cSir, the fence will cost approximately $50 million. \u001d I said,  \u001cWhat? \u001d (Laughter.) I kid you not, and we have thousands of things like that. Thousands. We \u0019re going to get it all down, but think of that: $50 million. Now, I assume it \u0019s a strong fence. (Laughter.) Okay? So, John, do you think you could do it for slightly less than $50 million? I think he could take $49 off right now and he \u0019d have plenty of profit. Right? Right, John? It \u0019s crazy. Also with us is Aaron Williams, a father of two who works in the field of information technology. Where \u0019s Aaron? Hello, Aaron. Hi. (Applause.) It \u0019s a good field. Aaron has seen the disastrous effects of high  \u0014 and just literally, high corporate tax rates right up close and personal, as more and more high-tech jobs are shipped overseas. You \u0019ve been watching it, Aaron. Right? All over. Like millions of other Americans, Aaron wants to bring those jobs back to the United States. We \u0019re going to reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they can keep jobs in America, Aaron; create jobs in America; compete for workers in America; and raise wages right here in America. You \u0019re going to be in a much different position. Okay? (Applause.) Thank you. Tremendous incentives. We want more products proudly stamped with those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. Right? (Applause.) Made in the USA. Finally, our framework encourages American companies to bring back the trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth that \u0019s parked overseas. Our current tax system  \u0014 (applause)  \u0014 trillions. And by the way, for years I \u0019ve been hearing it \u0019s 2.5 trillion. So I \u0019ve been hearing this for about five years, so I assume it \u0019s much more. Right? But Democrats want to do it, and Republicans want to do it. For years  \u0014 who doesn \u0019t want to do it? They want to bring  \u0014 but they can \u0019t do it because it \u0019s so restrictive, and the taxes are so ridiculous. So they can \u0019t do it. So the money stays in other countries, and it \u0019s invested in other countries. We want to bring it back. But think of it, it \u0019s one of the few things  \u0014 Democrats want it and Republicans want it. So they both want it, and yet for years they haven \u0019t been able to do it. Now we \u0019re doing it. We \u0019re doing things. (Applause.) You know, it \u0019s one thing when we want a healthcare and they want a healthcare, and there \u0019s a dispute. But here \u0019s something everybody wants and they can \u0019t do it. So you can tell you, there \u0019s a broken system in D.C., but we \u0019re getting it fixed rather  \u0014 I think  \u0014 rather rapidly. You \u0019ll be seeing that over the next few months. Our current tax system makes us one of the few developed nations in the world to punish our companies when they bring wealth earned overseas back into our country. We \u0019re punishing them for bringing the money back in. As a result, corporations have parked many trillions of dollars in foreign countries, and many have incorporated abroad in order to avoid our punitive tax system altogether. And some companies actually leave our country because they have so much money overseas  \u0014 so much, it \u0019s an incredible amount  \u0014 that they move the company to get their money. We \u0019re going to let them bring the money back home. (Applause.) Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We \u0019re punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States. We will impose a one-time low tax on returning money that is already offshore so that it can be brought back home to America where it belongs and where it can be put to work and work and work. (Applause.) The framework I \u0019ve just described represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce taxes, rebuild our economy, and restore America \u0019s competitive edge. Finally. (Applause.) And I have to say, just before coming here we released some of the details of the tax and the tax reform and the tax cuts, and it has really received tremendous, tremendous reviews. And if Senator Donnelly doesn \u0019t approve it, because you know he \u0019s on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn \u0019t believe. (Applause.) I think they \u0019re going to approve it. I think we \u0019ll have  \u0014 actually, I think we \u0019ll have numerous Democrats come across because it \u0019s the right thing to do. These reforms will be a dramatic change from a failed tax system that encourages American businesses to ship jobs to foreign countries that have much lower tax rates. It \u0019s what we can \u0019t do. Our competitors have much lower tax rates. But no longer. My administration strongly rejects this offshoring model, and we have embraced the new model. It \u0019s called  \u0014 the American model. (Applause.) Under the American model, we are reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. That \u0019s what we want. We want them to do business in our country, not to leave our country like a number of firms from Indiana. Some made some great promises to me, but those promises are only being partially kept because they \u0019re incentivized to leave. But now they \u0019re going to be incentivized to stay. And if that doesn \u0019t work, then we \u0019ll get even tougher than that. Okay? We want our companies to hire and grow in America and to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild American cities and towns. (Applause.) That is how we will all succeed together and grow together as one team, one people, and one American family. We want it to happen here. (Applause.) Tax reform has not historically been a partisan issue, and it does not have to be a partisan issue today. I really believe we \u0019re going to have numerous Democrats come over and sign because it \u0019s the right thing to do. I believe that it \u0019s the right thing to do, and I know many of them. And they \u0019re telling me it is the right thing to do. President Reagan \u0019s tax cuts were passed with significant bipartisan majorities at a time when there was a Democrat majority in the House and a Democrat Speaker  \u0014 Tip O \u0019Neill. Before that, Democrat President John F. Kennedy championed tax cuts that surged the economy and massively reduced unemployment. As President Kennedy very wisely said,  \u001cThe single most important fiscal weapon available to strengthen the national economy is the federal tax policy. The right kind of tax cut at the right time \u001d  \u0014 at the right time, this is the right time  \u0014  \u001cis the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward. \u001d That was President Kennedy. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut, and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together, finally, to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin middle-class miracle  \u0014 it \u0019s called a middle-class miracle, once again. It \u0019s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person. I truly believe that many Democrats want to support our plan, and with enough encouragement from the American people, they will find the courage to do what is right for our great country. (Applause.) But they \u0019ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard. Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first. And that \u0019s what we \u0019re doing. (Applause.) History has proven time and time again that there is no power on Earth more awesome than the will of the American people. That is why today I am asking all Americans  \u0014 Republican, Democrat, independent  \u0014 to join with me, and with each other to demand tax reform that will truly, truly, truly make America great again. (Applause.) Call your congressmen. Call your senators. Let them know you \u0019re watching. Let them know you \u0019re waiting. Tell them that today is the day for decision. That now is the time to heal this self-inflicted economic wound. And that with their action, the future will belong to all of us. If you demand it, the politicians will listen. They will answer, and they will act. And someday, many years from now, our children and our grandchildren will remember this moment in history as the time when ordinary Americans took control of their destiny and chose a future of American patriotism, prosperity, and pride. (Applause.) With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land, we will bring back our great American dreams. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"

   "text": "vice president michael r. pence. thank you. thank you to the acting director meroe park. thank you for 27 years serving the united states of america here at cia, with great distinction. it.s a great privilege for me to be with you today and to have the opportunity to introduce, at his first event, on his first full day, the new president of the united states, donald trump. as you can imagine, it.s deeply humbling for my family and i to find ourselves in this role. i.m grateful to our new president for the opportunity he.s given me and the opportunity the american people have given us to serve. but it.s especially humbling for me to be before all of you today—men and women of character, who have sacrificed greatly—and to stand before this hallowed wall, this memorial wall, where we remember 117 who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. i can assure you, this new president and our entire team recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices of all of the men and women of the intelligence community of the united states of america. i.ve gotten to know our new president. we traveled a lot together. when the cameras are off and the klieg lights are off—and i.ll tell you two things i know for sure. number one, i.ve never met anyone more dedicated to the safety and security of the people of the united states of america or anyone who is a greater strategic thinker about how we accomplish that for this nation. in fact, to understand the life of our new president is—his whole life was strategy. he built an extraordinary success in the private sector, and i know he.s going to make america safe again. and lastly, i can honestly tell you, for all my years serving in the congress, serving as governor of my home state, in traveling across the country and seeing the connection that he.s made to men and women who serve and protect in every capacity in this country, i.ve never met anyone with a greater heart for those who every day, in diverse ways, protect the people of this nation through their character and their service and their sacrifice. and so let me say, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you the president of the united states. the president. thank you. well, i want to thank everybody. very, very special people. and it is true, this is my first stop, officially. we.re not talking about the balls, and we.re not talking about even the speeches—although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday. [laughter] i always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely. [laughter] but i want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the cia than donald trump. there.s nobody. nobody. and the wall behind me is very, very special. we.ve been touring for quite a while, and i.ll tell you what—29? i can.t believe it. audience member. twenty-eight. the president. oh, 28. we.d better reduce it. [laughter] but that.s amazing. and we really appreciate what you.ve done in terms of showing us something very special. and your whole group, these are really special, amazing people. very, very few people could do the job you people do. and i want to just let you know, i am so behind you. and i know maybe sometimes you haven.t gotten the backing that you.ve wanted, and you.re going to get so much backing. maybe you.re going to say, please don.t give us so much backing. [laughter] mr. president, please, we don.t need that much backing. [laughter] but you.re going to have that. and i think everybody in this room knows it. you know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it—but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes. we were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military. and probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but i will not ask you to raise your hands if you did. [laughter] but i would guarantee a big portion, because we.re all on the same wavelength, folks. we.re all on the same wavelength, right? he knows. took brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we.re on the same wavelength. but we.re going to do great things. we.re going to do great things. we.ve been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we.ve ever fought. we have not used the real abilities that we have. we.ve been restrained. we have to get rid of isis. have to get rid of isis. we have no choice. radical islamic terrorism—and i said it yesterday—has to be eradicated just off the face of the earth. this is evil. this is evil. and you know, i can understand the other side. we can all understand the other side. there can be wars between countries; there can be wars. you can understand what happened. this is something nobody can even understand. this is a level of evil that we haven.t seen. and you.re going to go to it, and you.re going to do a phenomenal job. but we.re going to end it. it.s time. it.s time right now to end it. you have somebody coming on who is extraordinary. for the different positions of .secretary of this. and .secretary of that. and all of these great positions, i.d see five, six, seven, eight people. and we had a great transition. we had an amazing team of talent. and by the way, general flynn is right over here. put up your hand, mike. what a good guy. and reince and my whole group. reince—you know—they don.t care about reince. he.s, like, this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right? [laughter] we don.t have to talk about reince. but we did, we had just such a tremendous, tremendous success. so when i.m interviewing all of these candidates that reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and in this case, went so quickly—because i would see six or seven or eight for secretary of agriculture, who we just named the other day, sonny perdue, governor—former governor of georgia. fantastic guy. but i.d see six, seven, eight people for a certain position. everybody wanted it. but i met mike pompeo, and it was the only guy i met. i didn.t want to meet anybody else. i said, cancel everybody else. cancel. now, he was approved, essentially, but they.re doing little political games with me. he was one of the three. now, last night, as you know, general mattis, fantastic guy, and general kelly got approved. and mike pompeo was supposed to be in that group. it was going to be the three of them. can you imagine all of these guys? they—people respect—you know, they respect that military sense. all my political people, they.re not doing so well. the political people aren.t doing so well, but you. we.re going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others. but mike was literally—i had a group of what, we had nine different people? now, i must say, i didn.t mind cancelling eight appointments. that wasn.t the worst thing in the world. but i met him, and i said, he is so good. number one in his class at west point. now, i know a lot about west point. and to be one, you.re—it.s—i.m a person that very strongly believes in academics. in fact, every time i say i had an uncle who was a great professor at mit for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways. academically—he was an academic genius—and then they say, is donald trump an intellectual? trust me, i.m, like, a smart person. [laughter] and i recognized immediately. so he was number one at west point, and he was also essentially number one at harvard law school. and then, he decided to go into the military. and he ran for congress. and everything he.s done has been a home run. people like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him. and when i told paul ryan that i want to do this, i would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled, right, mike? because he said, i don.t want to lose this guy. but you will be getting a total star. you.re going to be getting a total gem. this is a gem. and i just—[applause]—good. you.ll see. you.ll see. and many of you know him anyway. but you.re going to see. and again, we have some great people going in. but this one is something—going to be very special, because this is one, if i had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps—you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important. you do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing. there can be—and the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful. but if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier. and boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly. and that.s what we have to do. we have to start winning again. you know, when i was young and when i was—of course, i feel young. i feel like i.m 30, 35, 39. [laughter] somebody said, are you young? i said, i think i.m young. you know, i was stopping—when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops. speeches, speeches, in front of 25, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop. i feel young. but when i was young—and i think we.re all, sort of, young. when i was young, we were always winning things in this country. we.d win with trade. we.d win with wars. at a certain age, i remember hearing from one of my instructors, .the united states has never lost a war.. and then, after that, it.s like we haven.t won anything. we don.t win anymore. the old expression, .to the victor belong the spoils.—you remember. i always used to say, keep the oil. i wasn.t a fan of iraq. i didn.t want to go into iraq. but i will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong. and i always said, in addition to that, keep the oil. now, i said it for economic reasons. but if you think about it, mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn.t have isis because that.s where they made their money in the first place. so we should have kept the oil. but okay. [laughter] maybe you.ll have another chance. but the fact is, should have kept the oil. i believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems. we have so many problems that are interrelated that we don.t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused. so i can only say that i am with you a thousand percent. and the reason you.re my first stop is that, as you know, i have a running war with the media. they are among the most dishonest human beings on earth. [laughter] right? and they, sort of, made it sound like i had a feud with the intelligence community. and i just want to let you know, the reason you.re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite—exactly. and they understand that too. and i was explaining about the numbers. we did a thing yesterday at the speech. did everybody like the speech? you had to like it, right? so i.ve been given good reviews. but we had a massive field of people. you saw that. packed. i get up this morning, i turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. i say, wait a minute, i made a speech. [laughter] i looked out, the field was—it looked like a million, million and a half people. they showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. and they said, donald trump did not draw well. [laughter] i said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but god looked down, and he said, we.re not going to let it rain on your speech. in fact, i—when i first started, i said, oh, no. first line, i hit—got hit by a couple of drops. [laughter] and i said, oh, this is too bad, but we.ll go right through it. but the truth is that it stopped immediately. it was amazing. and then, it became really sunny. then, i walked off and it poured right after i left. it poured. but you know, we have something that.s amazing because we had—it looked—honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. whatever it was, it was. but it went all the way back to the washington monument. and i turn on—and by mistake, i get this network, and it showed an empty field. and it said we drew 250,000 people. now, that.s not bad, but it.s a lie. we had 250,000 people literally around, you know, in the little bowl that we constructed. that was 250,000 people. the rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the washington monument, was packed. so we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty. and i think they.re going to pay a big price. we had another one yesterday, which was interesting. in the oval office there.s a beautiful statue of dr. martin luther king. and i also happen to like churchill, winston churchill. i think most of us like churchill. doesn.t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it. helped us; real ally. and as you know, churchill.s statue was taken out—the bust. and as you also probably have read, the prime minister is coming over to our country very shortly. and they wanted to know whether or not i.d like it back. i.d say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of churchill. so a reporter for time magazine—and i have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times. i think we have the alltime record in the history of time magazine. like, if tom brady is on the cover, it.s one time, because he won the super bowl or something, right? [laughter] i.ve been on for 15 times this year. i don.t think that.s a record, mike, that can ever be broken. do you agree with that? [laughter] what do you think? but i will say that they said—and it was very interesting—that donald trump took down the bust, the statue, of dr. martin luther king. and it was right there. but there was a cameraman that was in front of it. [laughter] so zeke—zeke from time magazine writes a story about i took down. i would never do that because i had great respect for dr. martin luther king. but this is how dishonest the media is. now, big story—the retraction was, like, where? what, was it a line? or do they even bother putting it in? so i only like to say that because i love honesty. i like honest reporting. i will tell you, final time—although i will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in—because i am coming back—we may have to get you a larger room. [laughter] we may have to get you a larger room. you know? and maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won.t have columns. [laughter] do you understand that? we.d get rid of the columns, but—[laughter]. no, i just wanted to really say that i love you, i respect you. there.s nobody i respect more. you.re going to do a fantastic job. and we.re going to start winning again, and you.re going to be leading the charge. so thank you all very much. thank you, beautiful. thank you all very much. have a good time. i.ll be back. i.ll be back. thank you."

   "text": "thank you. today i have the honor of welcoming my friend, prime minister benjamin netanyahu, to the white house. with this visit, the united states again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally, israel. the partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom, dignity, and peace. these are the building blocks of democracy. the state of israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression—i can think of no other state that.s gone through what they.ve gone—and of survival in the face of genocide. we will never forget what the jewish people have endured. your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds, is truly inspirational. the security challenges faced by israel are enormous, including the threat of iran.s nuclear ambitions, which i.ve talked a lot about. one of the worst deals i.ve ever seen is the iran deal. my administration has already imposed new sanctions on iran, and i will do more to prevent iran from ever developing—i mean ever—a nuclear weapon. our security assistance to israel is currently at an alltime high, ensuring that israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. both of our countries will continue and grow. we have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. america and israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life. this is one more reason why we reject unfair and one-sided actions against israel at the united nations—just treated israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target israel. our administration is committed to working with israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. that includes working toward a peace agreement between israel and the palestinians. the united states will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. we.ll be working on it very, very diligently. very important to me also, something we want to do. but it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. we.ll be beside them; we.ll be working with them. as with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. you know that, right? [laughter] prime minister netanyahu. both sides. president trump. i want the israeli people to know that the united states stands with israel in the struggle against terrorism. as you know, mr. prime minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten. those are the ideals to which we all—and will always—aspire and commit. this will be the first of many productive meetings. and i, again, mr. prime minister, thank you very much for being with us today. mr. prime minister, thank you. prime minister netanyahu. president trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and melania have shown me, my wife sara, our entire delegation. i deeply value your friendship. to me, to the state of israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke: israel has no better ally than the united states. and i want to assure you, the united states has no better ally than israel. our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership, i.m confident it will get even stronger. i look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field: in security, in technology, in cyber and trade and so many others. and i certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that israel is treated fairly in international forums and that the slander and boycotts of israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the united states of america. as you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests. and increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force: radical islamic terror. mr. president, you.ve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head on. you call for confronting iran.s terrorist regime, preventing iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal. and you have said that the united states is committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons. you call for the defeat of isis. under your leadership, i believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical islam. and in this great task, as in so many others, israel stands with you, and i stand with you. mr. president, in rolling back militant islam, we can seize an historic opportunity, because for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, arab countries in the region do not see israel as an enemy, but increasingly, as an ally. and i believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace. let us seize this moment together. let us bolster security. let us seek new avenues of peace. and let us bring the remarkable alliance between israel and the united states to even greater heights. thank you. thank you, mr. president. president trump. thank you. again, thank you. we.ll take a couple of questions. david brody, that.s christian broadcasting. david. former national security adviser michael t. flynn/israel.s west bank settlement policy/arab-israeli peace process q. thank you, mr. president, mr. prime minister. both of you have criticized the iran nuclear deal and at times even called for its repeal. i.m wondering if you.re concerned at all as it relates to not just the national security adviser, michael flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in russia—if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep iran from becoming a nuclear state. and secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page? how do you exactly term that, as it relates to the settlement issue? thank you. president trump. michael flynn, general flynn is a wonderful man. i think he.s been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as i call it, the fake media, in many cases. and i think it.s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. i think, in addition to that, from intelligence—papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. it.s criminal action, criminal act, and it.s been going on for a long time, before me. but now it.s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the democrats had under hillary clinton. i think it.s very, very unfair what.s happened to general flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally—i stress that—illegally leaked. very, very unfair. as far as settlements, i.d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. we.ll work something out. but i would like to see a deal be made. i think a deal will be made. i know that every president would like to. most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. and it wasn.t possible, because they didn.t do it. but bibi and i have known each other a long time, a smart man, great negotiator. and i think we.re going to make a deal. it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. that.s a possibility. so let.s see what we do. prime minister netanyahu. let.s try it. president trump. doesn.t sound too optimistic, but that.s—[laughter]. he.s a good negotiator. prime minister netanyahu. that.s the .art of the deal.. [laughter] president trump. i also want to thank—i also want to thank—sara, could you please stand up? you.re so lovely and you.ve been so nice to melania. i appreciate it very much. thank you. your turn. prime minister netanyahu. who is it? [inaudible]—yes, please. go ahead. arab-israeli peace process/location of u.s. embassy in israel q. thank you very much. mr. president, in your vision for the new middle east peace, are you ready to give up of the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration? and will you be willing to hear different ideas from the prime minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the west bank and unrestricted settlement constructions? and one more question: are you going to fulfill your promise to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem? and if so, when? and, mr. prime minister, did you come here tonight to tell the president that you.re backing off the two-state solution? thank you. president trump. so i.m looking at two-state and one-state, and i like the one that both parties like. [laughter] i.m very happy with the one that both parties like. i can live with either one. i thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. but honestly, if bibi and if the palestinians—if israel and the palestinians are happy, i.m happy with the one they like the best. as far as the embassy moving to jerusalem, i.d love to see that happen. we.re looking at it very, very strongly. we.re looking at it with great care—great care, believe me. and we.ll see what happens. okay? prime minister netanyahu. thank you. i read yesterday that an american official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you.d get eight different answers. well, mr. president, if you ask five israelis, you.d get 12 different answers. [laughter] but rather than deal with labels, i want to deal with substance. it.s something i.ve hoped to do for years in a world that.s absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance. so here.s the substance: there are two prerequisites for peace that i laid out 2 years—several years ago, and they haven.t changed. first, the palestinians must recognize the jewish state. they have to stop calling for israel.s destruction. they have to stop educating their people for israel.s destruction. second, in any peace agreement, israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the jordan river. because if we don.t, we know what will happen—because otherwise, we.ll get another radical islamic, terrorist state in the palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the middle east. now, unfortunately, the palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace. first, they continue to call for israel.s destruction: inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks. you have to read it to believe it. they even deny, mr. president, our historical connection to our homeland. and i suppose you have to ask yourself: why do—why are jews called jews? well, the chinese are called chinese because they come from china. the japanese are called japanese because they come from japan. well, jews are called jews because they come from judea. this is our ancestral homeland. jews are not foreign colonialists in judea. so, unfortunately, the palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present. they name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered israelis and, i have to say, also murdered americans. they fund—they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed taylor force, a wonderful young american, a west point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting israel. so this is the source of the conflict, the persistent palestinian refusal to recognize the jewish state in any boundary, this persistent rejectionism. that.s the reason we don.t have peace. now, that has to change. i want it to change. not only have i not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they.ve become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the middle east and has also, unfortunately, infected palestinian society. so i want this to change. i want those two prerequisites of peace—substance, not labels—i want them reinstated. but if anyone believes that i, as prime minister of israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they.re gravely mistaken. the two prerequisites of peace—recognition of the jewish state, and israel.s security needs west of the jordan—they remain pertinent. we have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward. and i believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound arab partners in their pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the palestinians. and i greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, mr. president, because i think that if we work together, we have a shot. president trump. and we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn.t been discussed before. and it.s actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. it would take in many, many countries, and it would cover a very large territory. so i didn.t know you were going to be mentioning that, but that.s—now that you did, i think it.s a terrific thing, and i think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. so we.ll see how that works out. katie from townhall [katie pavlich, townhall.com]. where.s katie? right there. katie. arab-israeli peace process q. thank you, mr. president. you said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. you.ve mentioned a halt on settlements. can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the israelis and for the palestinians? and, mr. prime minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat iran.s increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months, but the past couple of years as well? president trump. it.s actually an interesting question. i think that the israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard; it.s hard to do. they.re going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. i think our new concept that we.ve been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. and i think they.ll do that. i think they very much would like to make a deal, or i wouldn.t be happy, and i wouldn.t be here and i wouldn.t be as optimistic as i am. i really think they—i can tell you from the standpoint of bibi and from the standpoint of israel, i really believe they want to make a deal and they.d like to see the big deal. i think the palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they.re taught from a very young age. they.re taught tremendous hate. i.ve seen what they.re taught. and you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age, and it starts in the school room. and they have to acknowledge israel; they.re going to have to do that. there.s no way a deal can be made if they.re not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. and i think they.re going to be willing to do that also. but now i also believe we.re going to have, katie, other players at a very high level, and i think it might make it easier on both the palestinians and israel to get something done. okay? thank you. very interesting question. thank you. prime minister netanyahu. you asked about iran. one thing is preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons, something that president trump and i think are deeply committed to do. and we are obviously going to discuss that. i think, beyond that, president trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. he pointed out there are violations, iranian violations, on ballistic missile tests. by the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in hebrew, .israel must be destroyed.. the palestinian—rather the iranian foreign minister zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country. no. they write on the missile in hebrew, .israel must be destroyed.. so challenging iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on hizballah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the middle east and beyond, well beyond, i think that.s a change that is clearly evident. and since president trump took office, i welcome that. i think it.s—let me say this very openly: i think it.s long overdue. and i think that if we work together—and not just the united states and israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the iranian threat—then i think we can roll back iran.s aggression and danger. and that.s something that is important for israel, the arab states, but i think it.s vitally important for america. these guys are developing icbms. they.re developing—they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs. and they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on earth, and including—and especially, eventually—the united states. so this is something that is important for all of us. i welcome the change, and i intend to work with president trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger. president trump. great. do you have somebody? prime minister netanyahu. moav [moav vardi, israel.s channel 10]? 2016 presidential election/anti-semitism q. mr. president, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we.ve seen a sharp rise in anti-semitic incidents across the united states. and i wonder what you say to those among the jewish community in the states and in israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones. and, mr. prime minister, do you agree to what the president just said about the need for israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the west bank? and a quick follow-up on my friend.s questions—simple question: do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in bar-ilan speech, or you still support it? thank you. president trump. well, i just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had—306 electoral college votes. we were not supposed to crack 220. you know that, right? there was no way to 221, but then they said there.s no way to 270. and there.s tremendous enthusiasm out there. i will say that we are going to have peace in this country. we are going to stop crime in this country. we are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that.s going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time. i think one of the reasons i won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. very divided. and hopefully, i.ll be able to do something about that. and i—you know, it was something that was very important to me. as far as people—jewish people—so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. i think that you.re going to see a lot different united states of america over the next 3, 4, or 8 years. i think a lot of good things are happening, and you.re going to see a lot of love. you.re going to see a lot of love. okay? thank you. prime minister netanyahu. i believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict. i think it.s an issue; it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. and i think it also—we also are going to speak about it, president trump and i, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don.t keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. and we.re going to discuss this. on the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that i said. it.s the label. what does abu mazen mean by two states, okay? what does he mean? a state that doesn.t recognize the jewish state? a state that basically is open for attack against israel? what are we talking about? are we talking about costa rica, or are we talking about another iran? so obviously, it means different things. i told you what are the conditions that i believe are necessary for an agreement: it.s the recognition of the jewish state, and it.s israel.s—israel.s—security control of the entire area. otherwise, we.re just fantasizing. otherwise, we.ll get another failed state, another terrorist, islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace, but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope—any hope—for a peaceful future for our people. so i.ve been very clear about those conditions, and they haven.t changed. i haven.t changed. if you read what i said 8 years ago, it.s exactly that. and i repeated that again, and again, and again. if you want to deal with labels, deal with labels. i.ll deal with substance. and finally, one—if i can respond to something that i know from personal experience. i.ve known president trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people, his team, some of whom i.ve known for many years too. can i reveal, jared, how long we.ve known you? [laughter] well, he was never small. he was always big. [laughter] he was always tall. but i.ve known the president and i.ve known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the jewish people and the jewish state than president donald trump. i think we should put that to rest. president trump. thank you very much. very nice. i appreciate that very much."

    "text": "the first lady. thank you. let us pray: .our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us these days our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespasses against us. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. amen.. good afternoon. it is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the first lady of the united states. the america we envision is one that works for all americans and where all americans can work and succeed, a nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide. i will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me. i will act in the best interest of all of you. i.m committed to creating and supporting initiatives dear to my heart, which will have impact on women and children all around the world. my husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity. ladies and gentlemen, i.m proud to introduce the president of the united states, donald trump. audience members. melania! melania! melania! the president. thank you, everybody. thank you all. i didn.t know that melania was going to be saying the lord.s prayer, but i thought that was very beautiful. thank you. thank you. great. it.s so great to be here in florida, my second home, with you. this is a state i truly love. this is a state where we all had great victory together. thank you. it.s now been 1 month since my inauguration, and i am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making america great again. and i.m also here to tell you about our plans for the future. and they.re big, and they.re bold, and it.s what our country is all about, believe me. i.m here because i want to be among my friends and among the people. this was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country or probably anywhere else. this was a truly great movement, and i want to be here with you, and i will always be with you, i promise you that. i want to be in a room filled with hard-working american patriots who love their country, who salute their flag, and who pray for a better future. i also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. the dishonest media, which has published one false story after another, with no sources, even though they pretend they have them�“they make them up in many cases�“they just don.t want to report the truth, and they.ve been calling us wrong now for 2 years. they don.t get it, but they.re starting to get it, i can tell you that. they.ve become a big part of the problem. they are part of the corrupt system. thomas jefferson, andrew jackson, and abraham lincoln, and many of our greatest presidents, fought with the media and called them out, oftentimes on their lies. when the media lies to people, i will never, ever, let them get away with it. i will do whatever i can that they don.t get away with it. they have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda. in fact, thomas jefferson said, .nothing can [now]* be believed which is seen in a newspaper.. .truth itself,. he said, .becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle.. that was june 14, my birthday�“[laughter]�“1807. but despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are. and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win. we are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. we are free and independent people, and we will make our own choices. we are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. i hear your demands, i hear your voices, and i promise you i will deliver. i promise that. and by the way, you.ve seen what we.ve accomplished in a very short period of time. the white house is running so smoothly. so smoothly. and believe me, i and we inherited one big mess. that i can tell you. but i know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now, as i speak, being thrown out of the country, and they will not be let back in. we will have strong borders again. and i mean that. and you.ve seen it on television. you.ve seen it on television. general kelly, now secretary kelly, he.s really doing the job. you.re seeing it. the gang members�“bad, bad people. i said it day one. and they.re going out, or they.re being put in prison. but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. bring them back to where they came from. the fact is, you want great schools for your children, you want good, high-paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. you want a health care system, and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great health care plan that.s going to take the place of the disaster known as obamacare. it will be repealed and replaced. and for those people, the people that are put into rooms where republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn.t matter what they say�“for those people, just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower cost, okay? nothing to complain about. obamacare, remember, it is a disaster. you want low-cost american energy also, which means lifting the american restrictions on oil, on shale, on natural gas, and on clean, very clean coal. we.re going to put the miners back to work. the miners go back to work. you want us to enforce our immigration laws and to defend our borders. you want fair trade deals and a level playing field. we don.t have a level playing field. because you understand that when american workers win, america as a country wins and wins big. and every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the stupidity of our politicians. it.s not going to happen any longer. you want lower taxes, less regulation, millions of new jobs, and more products stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words: made in the u.s.a. you want to make it easier for companies to do business in america and harder for companies to leave. we don.t want companies saying, .everybody is fired, we.re moving to another country, we.re going to make the product, sell it across the border, and isn.t that wonderful?. not going to happen anymore. we.re going to have strong borders. and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they.re going to pay a 35-percent tax. and you know what? they.re never going to leave. they will never, ever leave. and you.ve seen that because i.ve already displayed it for the last 2 months, even before i got into office. they.re not leaving. and if they do, they.re going to pay a very, very big price for terminating the relationship to our workers. you want a government that serves the people, not the donors and not the special interests. in short, you want a government that keeps its promises. a great spirit of optimism is sweeping�“and you see it, it.s sweeping�“all across the country. look at what.s happening to the stock market. look at what.s happening to every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. it.s sweeping across the country. and in fact, every day for the last long period of days, the stock market, meaning companies, have been hitting new highs. they.re going to start hiring. it.s going to be a new day in america. you.re going to be proud again. jobs are already starting to pour back in. they.re coming back in like you haven.t seen in a long time. ford, general motors, fiat-chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs, investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. in arizona, intel�“great company�“just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brandnew, beautiful american jobs. i.ve followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job-killing disaster known as the trans-pacific partnership, tpp. we have just terminated our relationship to it. we.re going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they.re going to be bilateral or, as we would say, one-on-one. none of these deals where we get caught in quicksand, where we get mired in and we can.t do anything about it, like, by the way, nafta and so many others. and my administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation, which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. we.re going to end it. within a few days of taking the oath of office, i.ve taken steps to begin the construction of the keystone and the dakota access pipelines. anywhere from 30,000 to 40,000 jobs. and very importantly, as i was about to sign it, i said, who makes the pipe? who makes the pipe? something this audience understands very well, right? simple question. the lawyers put this very complex document in front. i said, who makes the pipe? they said, sir, it can be made anywhere. i said, not anymore. so i put a little clause in the bottom: the pipe has to be made in the united states of america if we.re going to have pipelines. we believe in two simple rules. and i can tell you, everybody in this massive�“this is a massive hangar; this is for the big planes. and by the way, do you think that one media group back there, that one network, will show this crowd? not one. not one. audience members. boo! the president. not one. they won.t show the crowd. you know, coming in on the plane�“and that plane represents so much�“and just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new air force one. can you believe this? i said, no way. i said, i refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. i refuse. so i got boeing in�“and it is actually two planes, a lot of people don.t know; the air force one project is actually two planes. why they need two planes, we.ll have to talk about that. but they have two planes. but we.ve got that price down by over a billion dollars. and i probably haven.t spoken, to be honest with you, for more than an hour on the project. but i got the generals in, who are fantastic. i got boeing in. but i told boeing it.s not good enough, we.re not going to do it; the price is still too high. on the f-35 fighter jet, we were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget, 7 years late. great plane. lockheed martin, a great plane. so think of it: they.re 7 years late, they.re hundreds of�“billions of dollars over budget. other than that, by the way, the project is going extremely well. [laughter] and i got the folks in from lockheed martin, who are terrific people and a terrific product, by the way. i also got boeing in. i said, do me a favor, give me a competing offer. and now they.re competing and fighting, and we.ve gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered. in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to lockheed and boeing. they would have signed contracts. so they.re going to make plenty of money, but it.s going to be a lot less than they would have made without trump. that i can tell you. and that.s�“you know you might as well know about it, because nobody talks. and by the way, that.s for fighter jets�“one of the biggest orders in the history of aviation, the order for the f-35; you.ve been reading about it�“because it was a disaster under the last administration. a disaster. and now we have it running beautifully. in fact, when the prime minister of japan�“prime minister abe, who.s great; great guy�“when he came over, he said, thank you. i said, for what? .you saved us many, many millions of dollars on the f-35 fighter jet.. because when i negotiated, i took our allies into the same negotiation. so the first thing he did was he thanked me for saving them money, and that.s good. okay? that.s good. i know the media will never thank me, so at least japan is thanking me, right? but we believe in two simple rules: buy american and hire american. we believe in them. we.ve just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. and by the way, a new director was just approved. can you imagine the length of time it.s taking the democrats? and i actually think it.s an embarrassment to them. but this is getting in to be record-setting territory. these are incredible people. scott pruitt was just approved, just now approved, for the environmental protection agency. he.ll do so good. he.ll do so good. but he won.t have projects going 10 and 12 years and then getting rejected. and they may be rejected, but they.ll be rejected quickly. but for the most part, they.re going to be accepted, they.re going to be environmentally friendly, and he is going to be a great secretary. he will be amazing. so we.re very happy. that took place yesterday. that.s going to be a big difference, because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. it was impossible to navigate for companies. and what did it really mean? forget about the companies. what did it mean? it meant no jobs. it meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things that they.d rather do here. so we.re going to have a whole big situation. we are going to unfree all of those companies. they are going to be�“they.re going to have freedom. they.re going to be able to build what they want to build. it will be environmentally friendly. and we.re going to start producing jobs like you.ve never seen before. that.s going to happen. that was a big thing. we.re standing up for the incredible men and women, always, of law enforcement. we.re standing up. and i can tell you, the military and law enforcement, they stood up big. i don.t say for me�“i.m the messenger, folks; i.m the messenger. they stood up for us in this last election. we got numbers that nobody believed were possible, from law enforcement and from military; basically, people that wear uniforms like us. isn.t that nice? and i saw this man on television just now. you�“i just saw him on television. he said: .i love trump. let trump do what he has to do.. that.s my guy, right there. it.s true. come here. come here. no, i just�“i.m coming in. that.s okay. let him up. let him up. i.m not worried about him. i.m only worried he.s going to give me a kiss. i.m not worried about anything else. this guy is so great. he was one of many people�“they.re interviewing people in the line�“and i have to say, there.s a tiny group of protestors out there, and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people. but they interviewed this man. come on up here. come on up. guy was great. hop over the fence. come on. he can do it. this guy is in good shape. look at him. look at this guy. come on. this guy is great. don.t worry about him. no, no, no come here. they.re going to throw�“come on up. come on. come here. this guy�“so he.s been all over television, saying the best things, and i see him standing. and didn.t you get here like at four in the morning? boynton beach, fl, resident gene huber. i did, sir. the president. say a couple of words to this crowd. mr. huber. mr. president, thank you, sir. we, the people, our movement, is the reason why our president of the united states is standing here in front of us today. when president trump, during their election, promised all these things that he was going to do for us, i knew he was going to do this for us. thank you, mr. president. mr. president, thank you so much, sir. the president. a star is born. a star is born. thank you. that.s fine. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. i wouldn.t say that secret service was thrilled with that�“[laughter]�“but we know our people, right? we know our people. he.s a great guy. and so many others. i see some others, they.re being interviewed. i see them over here. they started�“they came at 4 in the morning. the media will give them no credit. the media, as i told you, they won.t show this crowd. look at that, all the way outside of�“this is as big a hangar as you get. all the way outside, way back to the fences. amazing. i want to thank you. but i want to thank everybody. so i.ve directed the department of justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs and police from crimes of violence against them. we will work with our police, not against our police. our police do a great job, and they.ve never been troubled like they.re troubled now. it.s very unfair what.s happening. so we want to cherish our law enforcement, and we will always protect those who protect us. we.ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in america, including our inner cities. we.re going to make our inner cities safe again. look at what.s going on. look at what.s happening in chicago: hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. i.ll tell you, what.s happening in chicago and many other places. safety is a civil right, and we will fight to make america totally safe again. i.ve ordered the department of homeland security and the department of justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels, which are all over the united states, and we are going to stop the drugs from pouring into your country, into your community, into your cities, and poisoning our youth. we.re stopping it. we.re stopping it. we.ve taken historic action to secure the southern border, and i.ve ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly. and i.ve taken decisive action to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. so you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing, and so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court, originally by a judge, and then a�“�“ audience members. boo! the president. yes, it.s very sad. and you know, the reason is for protection and safety. so the statute is so plain and so clear. i said last week�“i was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in washington, and i said, if you have a college education, you can understand it; if you have a high school education, you can understand it; if you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it. and i was told�“i.ll check, but i found it hard to believe�“in an over 30-page decision by the appellate court, three judges�“and you could tell by the way they were reacting, because it was broadcast on television, and everything we do gets a lot of people watching. so you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn.t looking good. and when they wrote their decision, as i understand it�“maybe i.m wrong�“but they didn.t write the statute that they were making the decision about, because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. so i thought i.d read it, and here.s what it says. this is what it says: .whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the united states.�“okay, so essentially, whenever somebody comes into the united states, right�“if it .would be detrimental to the interests of the united states.�“okay, now you know the countries we.re talking about, and these were countries picked by obama; they weren.t even picked�“they were picked by obama�“.he may.�“so the president may�“.by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary.�“now, because it.s old, it should have said he or she, right? they were not politically correct when they drew this. in fact, that.s the only thing that was actually wrong with it. he or she�“but i don.t think the women care too much about that, right? i don.t think so. by the way, we did very well with women. you know, my wife said, when some of these phony polls were put out�“you know, the cnn poll was so far off�“the phony polls. but when some of these phony�“she said, what.s wrong with you and women? we did very nicely with women. we did nicely with a lot of groups that they didn.t think we were going to do so nicely with. i guess we had to. that.s why we.re all here tonight, right? so, and it goes, .. . . and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.. so basically, it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it.s not in the best interest of our country. right? unbelievable. unbelievable. and i listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. so unfair. so we.ll be doing something over the next couple of days. we don.t give up. we never give up. we had a court that i disagree with, i disagree with big league. and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television, when other lawyers come on, many of them can.t even understand. they.re saying, how do you come up with that decision? it cannot be more simple. so they.re ruling on what i just read you, and they don.t even quote it in their ruling�“because you can.t, because it.s too obvious. so we will do something next week. i think you.ll be impressed. let.s see what happens. here.s the bottom line: we.ve got to keep our country safe. you look at what.s happening. we.ve got to keep our country safe. you look at what.s happening in germany. you look at what.s happening last night in sweden. sweden! who would believe this? sweden! they took in large numbers. they.re having problems like they never thought possible. you look at what.s happening in brussels. you look at what.s happening all over the world. take a look at nice. take a look at paris. we.ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people. there was no documentation. there was no nothing. so we.re going to keep our country safe. and we all have heart, by the way. and what i want to do is build safe zones in syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country�“that mess that i was left by obama and everybody else. folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn.t believe. but we.re going to build safe zones. we.re going to have those safe zones. you know, we do owe $20 trillion, okay? so we.re going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. they have nothing but money. and we.re going to do it that way, instead of taking massive numbers�“tens of thousands of people�“into our country, and we don.t know anything about those people. we want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. we want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. we want people that are going to be great for our country. we don.t want people with bad, bad ideas. we don.t want that. i.ve also directed the defense community, headed by general, and now sec�“oh, you know, he said it�“he said it�“and now secretary .mad dog. mattis�“to develop a plan to totally destroy isis. i have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. we will pursue peace through strength. our military is badly depleted. you have planes in the military where the father flew them and now the son is flying them, they.re so old. we make the best equipment anywhere in the world. we.re going to start using our best and most modern equipment. and we.re going to make sure that our veterans have the care they need when they come home. we love our veterans. we.re going to do a great job for our veterans. our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. these are our great, great people. we owe them so much. our veterans are going to be taken care for once and for all. our system and our country has let down our veterans. we are not going to let that go on any further. you wait and you see what we.re going to be doing for our great veterans. thank you, veterans, for all�“who.s here? who.s a veteran? we.re going to take care of our veterans. we.re going to downsize the bloated bureaucracy and make government lean and accountable. we are going to drain the swamp in washington, dc. audience members. drain the swamp! drain the swamp! drain the swamp! the president. i.ve already imposed�“i.m not sure they.re too happy about it�“a 5 year lobbying ban on executive branch officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. and there.s another major promise i have kept to the american people: i.ve nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late, great justice scalia. his name is judge neil gorsuch. and he comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. he.s an incredible, and he has an incredible résumé. he.s respected by all. his education is as good as it can get. his writings are truly amazing. he will be a true defender of our constitution. so let.s tell the senate democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country. because what.s happening with the democrats�“no wonder they.re doing so badly. no wonder they.re doing so badly. you take a look. race after race�“i just want to tell you, in case you didn.t read it�“of course, you.re reading the fake news�“[laughter]�“but the democrats were supposed to win the presidency. that didn.t happen. they were supposed to take over the senate. that didn.t happen. and they were supposed to take over, potentially, even the house. it was going to be, 4 weeks out, the greatest defeat in the modern history of american politics. and it was, but it was for the democrats, not for the republicans. so we have to tell the democrats�“because they.re doing the wrong thing for the american people�“to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. they.ve got to get on with it. my administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. we are working to lower tax rates on the middle class, to reduce tax rates, big league, on businesses, and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all americans so it.s understandable by everyone. senate democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs. but the democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. we.re not going to let that happen. it.s also time for the senate democrats to take responsibility for obamacare, and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nationwide health care tragedy. it.s a tragedy. you look at some states�“arizona�“up 116 percent. and your deductibles have gotten so high that you can never use it. obamacare doesn.t work. it.s become totally unaffordable. remember they said the health care�“it.s unaffordable. it doesn.t work. and i said to the republicans, i said, you want to do something great politically? don.t do anything. sit back for 2 years, let it explode; the democrats will come and beg for us to do something. but we can.t do that to the american people. we have to fix it, and we will. we need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation. you are all part of this incredible movement, this movement that we talk about so much, that.s been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. it.s a movement that is just sweeping�“it.s sweeping�“across our country. it.s sweeping, frankly, across the globe. look at brexit. look at brexit. much smaller example, but it.s still something you can look at. people want to take back control of their countries, and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family. the nation-state remains the best model for human happiness, and the american nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom, and justice on the face of god.s earth. and now we have spirit like we.ve never had before. it.s now that we have our sacred duty, and we have no choice, and we want this choice: to defend our country, to protect its values, and to serve its great, great citizens. erasing national borders does not make people safer or more prosperous; it undermines democracy and trades away prosperity. we.re giving it away. the so-called global elite have done very well for themselves, but have left working families with shrinking wages, really�“i mean, they are shrinking. eighteen years ago, many of you in this room made more money working one job than you.re making right now working two and three jobs. instead of peace, we.ve seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. we don.t fight to win. we fight politically correct wars. we don.t win anymore. we don.t win at trade. we don.t win in any capacity. we don.t win anymore. we.re going to start winning again, believe me. and we have the chance now, working together, to deliver change for the ages�“this will be change for the ages, change like never before�“to pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. we want to secure our borders and protect our workers, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure, to fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods, to bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities, to ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce, to reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation, and to replace chasms of distrust with new bridges of opportunity and cooperation. we must ignore the tired echoes of yesterday.s fights. we.re fighting battles that no longer help us. we.re fighting battles that other people aren.t treating us fairly in the fight. i.m a nato fan, but many of the countries in nato, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. they.re not paying their bills. they.re not paying their bills. they have to help us. no longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. no longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about but failure. new circumstances demand new solutions. americans have fought and won wars together. our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next, stretching back to the first day of our american independence. this is our legacy. it belongs to all of you. and it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation. now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold action. let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. we are all brothers and all sisters. we share one home, one destiny, and one glorious american flag. we.re united together by history and by providence. we will make america strong again, i promise. we will make america proud again. we will make america safe again. and we will make america great again, greater than ever before. may god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america. thank you. thank you. thank you, very much."

   "text": "thank you, everybody. so great to be with you. thank you. great to be back at cpac. it.s a place i have really.“.“ audience member. we love you! the president. i have.“i love this place. love you people. so thank you. thank you very much. first of all, i want to thank matt schlapp, and his very, very incredible wife.“and boss.“[laughter].“mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great. when i watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance. so, i want to thank matt and mercedes. and when matt called and asked, i said, absolutely, i.ll be there with you. i mean, the real reason i said it: i didn.t want him to go against me, because that one you can.t beat. so i said, absolutely. and it really is an honor to be here. i wouldn.t miss a chance to talk to my friends. these are my friends. and we.ll see you again next year and the year after that, and i.ll be doing this with cpac whenever i can, and i.ll make sure that we.re here a lot. you know, if you remember, my first major speech.“sit down, everybody. come on. [laughter] you know, the dishonest media, they.ll say he didn.t get a standing ovation. you know why. [laughter] no, you know why. because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation, right. that.s the way they work. [applause] they are the worst. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. so sit down. [laughter] .donald trump did not get a standing ovation.. they leave out the part, they never sat down. they leave that out. so i just want to thank.“but you know, my first major speech was at cpac. and probably, 5 or 6 years ago.“first major political speech. and you were there. and it was.“i loved it. i love the people. i love the commotion. and then, they did these polls where i went through the roof, and i wasn.t even running, right. but it gave me an idea, and i got a little bit concerned when i saw what was happening in the country, and i said, let.s go to it. so it was very exciting. i walked the stage on cpac. i.ll never forget it, really. i had very little notes and even less preparation. so when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, i said, i think i like this business. i would have come last year, but i was worried that i would be, at that time, too controversial. we wanted border security. we wanted very, very strong military. we wanted all of the things that we.re going to get, and people considered that controversial. but you didn.t consider it controversial. so i.ve been with cpac for a long time. all of these years, we.ve been together. and now you finally have a president. finally. took you a long time. [applause] took you a long time. and it.s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me.“believe me. you did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make america great again. the media didn.t think we would win. audience member. they knew. [laughter] the president. the pundits.“you.re right. they had an idea. the pundits didn.t think we.d win. the consultants that suck up all that money. oh, they suck it up, they.re so good. [laughter] they.re not good at politics, but they.re really good at sucking up people.s money. especially my opponent.s, because i kept them down to a minimum. but the consultants didn.t think we would win. but they all underestimated the power of the people, you. and the people proved them totally wrong. never.“and this is so true, and this is what.s been happening.“never underestimate the people. never. i don.t think it will ever happen again. and i want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. it.s fake, phony, fake. a few days ago, i called the fake news .the enemy of the people,. and they are. they are the enemy of the people. because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. i saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. there are no nine people. i don.t believe there was one or two people. nine people. and i said, give me a break. because i know the people. i know who they talked to. there were no nine people. but they say, nine people, and somebody reads it, and they think, oh, nine people. they have nine sources. they make up sources. they are very dishonest people. in fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that i called the fake news the enemy of the people.“the fake news. they dropped off the word .fake.. and all of a sudden, the story became, the media is the enemy. they take the word .fake. out, and now i.m saying, oh, no, this is no good. [laughter] but that.s the way they are. so i.m not against the media. i.m not against the press. i don.t mind bad stories if i deserve them. and i tell you, i love good stories, but we won.t talk.“[laughter].“i don.t get too many of them. but i am only against the fake news media or press.“fake, fake. they have to lead that word. i.m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. they shouldn.t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody.s name. let their name be put out there. let their name be put out. .a source says that donald trump is a horrible, horrible human being.. let them say it to my face. let there be no more sources. and remember this.“and in.“not all in all cases. i mean, i had a story written yesterday about me in reuters by a very honorable man. it was a very fair story. there are some great reporters around. they.re talented; they.re honest as the day is long. they.re great. but there are some terrible, dishonest people, and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. a tremendous disservice. they are very dishonest people, and they shouldn.t use sources. they should put the name of the person. you will see stories dry up like you.ve never seen before. [laughter] so you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story.“and i put myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, you.re not part of the story, and if you.re not part of the story, then you sort of know. if you are part of the story, you know what they.re saying is true or not. so when they make it up, and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election.“polls, polls. the polls. they come out with these polls, and everybody was so surprised. actually, a couple of polls got it right. i must say, los angeles times did a great job. shocking, because.“you know. [laughter] they did a great job. and we had a couple of others that were right. but generally speaking, i mean, i can tell you the network. somebody said a poll came out. and i say, what network is it. and they.ll say, a certain.“let.s not even mention names right. should we. well, you have a lot of them. look, the .clinton news network. is one. [laughter] totally. take a look. honestly. take a look at their polls over the last 2 years. now, you.d think they.d fire the pollster, right. after years and years of getting battered. but i don.t.“i mean, who knows, maybe they.re just bad at polling. or maybe they.re not legit. but it.s one or the other. look at how inaccurate.“look at cbs, look at abc also. look at nbc. take a look at some of these polls. they.re so bad, so inaccurate. and what that does is, it creates a false narrative. it creates, like, this narrative that.s just, like, we.re not going to win, and people say: .oh, i love trump, but you know i.m not feeling great today. he can.t win. so i won.t go and vote. i won.t go and vote.. it creates a whole false deal, and we have to fight it folks. we have to fight it. they.re very smart, they.re very cunning, and they.re very dishonest. so just to conclude, i mean, it.s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories. they say that we can.t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the first amendment. you know, they always bring up the first amendment. [laughter] and i love the first amendment. nobody knows.“loves it better than me. nobody. i mean, who uses it more than i do. but the first amendment gives all of us.“it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all americans.“the right to speak our minds freely. it gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly. and many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it.s not your agenda, and it.s not the country.s agenda. it.s their own agenda. they have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. but as you saw throughout the entire campaign.“and even now.“the fake news doesn.t tell the truth. doesn.t tell the truth. so just in finishing, i say it doesn.t represent the people. it never will represent the people. and we.re going to do something about it, because we have to go out, and we have to speak our minds, and we have to be honest. our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. and i.m here fighting for you, and i will continue to fight for you. the victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law. our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values. and our victory was a win for everyone who believes it.s time to stand up for america, to stand up for the american worker, and to stand up for the american flag. yes, there we should stand up. come on. [applause] there we should stand up. okay. and by the way, we love our flag. and by the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed; there are lines that go back six blocks. and i tell you that because you won.t read about it, okay. [laughter] but there are lines that go back six blocks. there is such love in this country for everything we stand for. you saw that on election day. and you.re going to see it more and more. so we.re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. there.s never been anything like this. there.s been some movements, but there.s never been anything like this. there.s been some movements that petered out, like bernie.“petered out. [laughter] but it was a little rigged against him.“you know, superdelegate, superdelegate. she had so many delegates before the thing even started. i actually said to my people, how does that happen. [laughter] not that i.m a fan of bernie, but a lot of bernie people voted for trump. you know why. because he.s right on one issue: trade. he was right about trade. our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. so he was right about that, but we got a lot of bernie support. so actually, i like bernie, okay. i like bernie. but i.m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the republican party and for the future of america. first, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. the core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. for too long, we.ve traded away our jobs to other countries.“so terrible. we.ve defended other nations. borders while leaving ours wide open; anybody can come in. audience members. build a wall! build it! the president. oh, we.re going to build the wall, don.t worry about it. we.re building the wall. we.re building the wall. in fact, it.s going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule. [applause] it.s way, way, way ahead of schedule. it.s going to start very soon. general kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job. fantastic job he.s done. and remember, we are getting the bad ones out. these are bad dudes. we.re getting the bad ones out, okay. we.re getting the bad.“if you watch these people it.s like, oh, gee, that.s so sad. we.re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn.t be.“whether it.s drugs or murder or other things. we.re getting bad ones out. those are the ones that go first, and i said it from day one. basically, all i.ve done is keep my promise. we.ve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. in the middle east, we.ve spent, as of 4 weeks ago, $6 trillion. think of it. audience members. boo! the president. and by the way, the middle east is in worse.“i mean, it.s not even close.“it.s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. if our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now. that i can tell you. be a hell of a lot better. we could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. this is the situation that i inherited. i inherited a mess, believe me. we also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. now, i.ve been watching.“and nobody says it.“but obamacare doesn.t work, folks. it.s.“i mean, i could say.“i could talk.“it doesn.t work. and now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you.re watching, they.re not you. they.re largely, many of them are, the side that lost. you know, they lost the election. it.s, like, how many elections do we have to have. they lost the election. [laughter] but i always say, obamacare doesn.t work. and these same people, 2 years and a year ago, were complaining about obamacare. and the bottom line: we.re changing it. we.re going to make it much better. we.re going to make it less expensive. we.re going to make it much better. obamacare covers very few people. and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved, that was taken away from them; it was taken away from them. millions of people were very happy with their health care. they had their doctor; they had their plan. remember the lie.“28 times: .you can keep your doctor; you can keep your plan..“over and over and over again you heard it. so we.re going to repeal and replace obamacare. and i tell paul ryan and all of the folks that we.re working with very hard.“dr. tom price, very talented guy.“but i tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. let it implode completely. it.s already imploding; you see the carriers are all leaving. i mean, it.s a disaster. but 2 years, don.t do anything. the democrats will come to us and beg for help. they.ll beg, and it.s their problem. but it.s not the right thing to do for the american people. it.s not the right thing to do. we inherited a national debt that has doubled in 8 years. think of it.“$20 trillion. it.s doubled. and we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. we don.t win anymore. when was the last time we won. do we win a war. do we win anything. audience member. when you got elected! the president. do we win anything. we.re going to win. we.re going to win big, folks. we.re going to start winning again, believe me. we.re going to win. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. but we.re taking a firm, bold, and decisive measure.“we have to.“to turn things around. the era of empty talk is over. it.s over. now is the time for action. so let me tell you about the actions that we.re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the american people and on my promise to make america great again. we.ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the united states and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall. by doing this.“and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ice, with the help of general kelly, and all of the people that are so passionate about this.“our border patrol, i.ll tell you what they do. they came and endorsed me; ice came and endorsed me. they never endorsed a presidential candidate before. they might not even be allowed to. [laughter] but they were disgusted with what they saw. and we.ll stop it. we.ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. pouring in, pouring in. we get the drugs; they get the money. we get the problems; they get the cash. no good, no good. going to stop. by stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that.s so important because the tax.“the dollars that we.re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. and the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling american communities, including our inner cities. we are also going to save countless american lives. as we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, and the criminal aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country. and we will not let them back in. they.re not coming back in, folks. if they do, they.re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of. i.m also working with the department of justice to begin reducing violent crime. i mean, can you believe what.s happening in chicago, as an example. two days ago, seven people were shot.“.“ audience member. chiraq! [laughter] the president. .“.“and, i believe, killed. seven people. seven people. chicago, a great american city. seven people shot and killed. we will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. [applause] thank you. and thank them. i.ve also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn america from the trans-pacific partnership so that we can protect our economic freedom. and we are going to make trade deals, but we.re going to do one-on-one, one-on-one. and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal. and then, they.ll come back, and we.ll make a better deal. none of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster. just take a look.“by the way, take a look at nafta, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development. it.s economic undevelopment, as far as our country is concerned. we.re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare. we.re going to save americans from this crisis and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. we have authorized the construction, one day, of the keystone and dakota access pipelines and issued a new rule. this took place while i was getting ready to sign. i said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline. well, sir, it comes from all over the world. isn.t that wonderful. i said, nope, it comes from the united states, or we.re not building it. american steel. if they want a pipeline in the united states, they.re going to use pipe that.s made in the united states, do we agree. but can you imagine.“i told this story the other day.“can you imagine the gentleman.“never met him, don.t even know the name of his company. i actually sort of know it, but i want to get it exactly correct. big, big, powerful company. they spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline.“same thing with the dakota, different place. they got their approvals, everything, in the case of dakota, then all of a sudden, they couldn.t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. but with the keystone, so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking the blood out of the company.“.don.t worry..“i.ve used them all my life, okay.“.don.t worry, we.re going to get it approved, i.m connected, i.m a lobbyist, don.t worry.. bottom line, obama didn.t sign it. right. could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there. a lot of jobs. didn.t sign it. but can you imagine. he gave up. a year ago, it was dead. now he.s doing nothing, calling his wife, .hello, darling, i.m a little bored, you know that pipeline.. that has killed us, that has killed our company. knock, knock. .mr. so-and-so, the keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere, has just been approved.. now, can you imagine the expression. and you know the sad part. the same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed. they.re now going to go back to him and say, didn.t we do a great job. we want more money, right, because that.s the way the system works. a little bit off, but that.s the way the system works. we.re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on american energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and beautiful clean coal, and we.re going to put our miners back to work. miners are going back to work. miners are going back to work, folks. sorry to tell you that, but they.re going back to work. we have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy.“crushing. and not only our economy, crushing our jobs, because companies can.t hire. we.re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. and by the way, i want regulation. i want to protect our environment. i want regulations for safety. i want all of the regulations that we need, and i want them to be so strong and so tough. but we don.t need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries. that we don.t need. but we.re going to have regulations. it.s going to be really strong and really good, and we.re going to protect our environment, and we.re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers. okay. another major promise is tax reform. we are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on american business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. [applause] thank you. in anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country. you see that. in fact, i think i did more than any other pre-president.“they say president-elect. president-elect is meeting with ford; he.s meeting with chrysler; he.s meeting with general motors. i just wanted to save a little time. [laughter] because ford and fiat-chrysler, general motors, sprint, intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the united states, expanding production and hiring more workers. and they.re going back to michigan, and they.re going back to ohio, and they.re going back to pennsylvania, and they.re going back to north carolina and to florida. it.s time for all americans to get off of welfare and get back to work. you.re going to love it! you.re going to love it. [applause] you are going to love it. we.re also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military. and we will be substantially upgrading all of our military.“all of our military.“offensive, defensive, everything. bigger and better and stronger than ever before. and hopefully, we.ll never have to use it. but nobody is going to mess with us, folks. nobody. it will be one of the greatest military buildups in american history. no one will dare to question.“as they have been, because we.re very depleted, very, very depleted. sequester. sequester. nobody will dare question our military might again. we believe in peace through strength, and that.s what we will have. as part of my pledge to restore safety for the american people, i have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate isis. working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the earth. at the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. foreign terrorists will not be able to strike america if they cannot get into our country. and by the way, take a look at what.s happening in europe, folks. take a look at what.s happening in europe. i took a lot of heat on sweden. [laughter] and then, a day later, i said, has anybody reported what.s going on. audience member. no, they haven.t. the president. and it turned out that they didn.t.“not too many of them did. [laughter] take a look at what happened in sweden. i love sweden. great country. great people. i love sweden. but they understand i.m right. the people over there understand i.m right. take a look at what.s happening in sweden. take a look at what.s happening in germany. take a look at what.s happened in france. take a look at nice and paris. i have a friend; he.s a very, very substantial guy. he loves the city of lights. he loves paris. for years, every year, during the summer, he would go to paris.“it was automatic.“with his wife and his family. i hadn.t seen him in a while. and i said, jim, let me ask you a question: how.s paris doing. .paris. i don.t go there anymore. paris is no longer paris.. that was 4 years.“4, 5 years.“hasn.t gone there. he wouldn.t miss it for anything. now he doesn.t even think in terms of going there. take a look at what.s happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart. we have to be smart. we can.t let it happen to us. so let me state this as clearly as i can: we are going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. we will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brandnew action to protect out people and keep america safe. you will see the action. i will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the american people. i won.t do it. if it means i get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it.s okay. it doesn.t bother me. the security of our people is number one.“is number one. our administration is running with great efficiency, even though i still don.t have my cabinet approved. nobody mentions that. do you know i still have people out there waiting to be approved. and everyone knows they.re going to be approved. it.s just a delay, delay, delay. it.s really sad. it.s really sad. and these are great people. these are some great people. we still don.t have our cabinet. i assume we.re setting records for that. that.s the only thing good about it is, we.re setting records. i love setting records. but i hate having a cabinet meeting, and i see all these empty seats. i said, democrats, please, approve our cabinet and get smart on health care too, if you don.t mind. [laughter] but we.re taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science, and industry. yesterday i had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office: caterpillar tractor, campbell.s soup. we had everybody. we had everybody. i like campbell.s soup. [laughter] we had everybody, and we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big massive new plants and lots of jobs. and you know what. they.re going to be building them in this country, not in some other country. we.re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement, and we.re meeting with leaders from all around the world, where the white house doors used to be totally closed.“they were closed, folks. you don.t realize that. they were closed. audience member. he was afraid. the president. they.re now wide open. and they.re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. and when they come into the white house, we.re translating these meetings into action. one by one, we.re checking off the promises we made to the people of the united states. one by one, a lot of promises. and we will not stop until the job is done. we will reduce your taxes. we will cut your regulations. we will support our police. we will defend our flag. we will rebuild our military. we will take care of our great, great veterans. we.re taking care of our veterans. we will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good.“none of them. you wonder, where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. where did they come from. audience member. government. the president. well, they came also from campaign contributions, i must be honest with you. [laughter] they.re not as stupid as you think. [laughter] we will cut wasteful spending. we will promote our values. we will rebuild our inner cities. we will bring back our jobs and our dreams. audience member. amen! the president. so true. so true. and by the way, we will protect our second amendment very well. you know, wayne and chris are here from the nra, and they didn.t have that on the list. it.s lucky i thought about it. [laughter] but we will indeed. and they.re great people. and by the way, they love our country. they love our country. the nra has been a great supporter. they love our country. the forgotten men and women of america will be forgotten no longer. that is the heart of this new movement and the future of the republican party. people came to vote, and these people.“the media.“they said, where are they coming from. what.s going on here. these are hard-working, great, great americans. these are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. hillary called them .deplorable.. audience members. boo! the president. they.re not deplorable. audience members. lock her up! lock her up! lock her up! the president. who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly. [laughter] that.s the problem in politics. one wrong word and it.s over. she also said .irredeemable,. but we won.t mention that. [laughter] the gop will be, from now on, the party also of the american worker. you know, we haven.t been, as a group, given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle. during the early days when we had 17 people running.“the primaries.“millions and millions of people were joining. now, i won.t say it was because of me, but it was, okay. [laughter] and we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see america be great again, and it will see it. and it.s going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me. a lot sooner than you think. we will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the united states of america, believe me. global cooperation.“dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries.“is good. it.s very important. but there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. this is the united states of america that i.m representing. i.m not representing the globe. i.m representing your country. audience members. u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.! the president. there is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to america. america.“it.s the allegiance to america. no matter our background or income or geography, we are all citizens of this blessed land. and no matter our color or the blood.“the color of the blood we bleed, it.s the same red blood of great, great patriots. remember. great patriots. we all salute, with pride, the same american flag. and we are equal.“totally equal.“in the eyes of almighty god. we.re equal. [applause] thank you. and i want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the christian community. communities of faith.“rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers.“because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for trump. so i want to thank you folks. it was amazing.“an amazing outpouring, and i will not disappoint you. as long as we have faith in each other, and trust in god, then there is no goal, at all, beyond our reach. there is no dream too large, no task too great. we are americans, and the future belongs to us. the future belongs to all of you. and america is coming about, and it.s coming back, and it.s roaring, and you can hear it. it.s going to be bigger and better. it is going to be. it is going to be. remember. and it.s roaring. it.s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. i want to thank you. and matt and mercedes, i want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that i have. i see them. they.re all over the place. you are really great people. i want to thank you. and i want to say to you, god bless you.“.“ audience member. god bless you! the president. .“.“and god bless the united states of america. thank you, folks. thank you."

   "text": "vice president michael r. pence. well, good evening to you all. fellow americans, irish friends, distinguished guests: i.m mike pence, and i.m the 48th vice president of the united states of america. and it is my honor.“[applause].“it.s my honor, along with my wife, karen pence, to welcome you on behalf of the first family to the white house on this very special occasion. it is such an honor for the two of us to be able to welcome you here and welcome a special guest to the white house and, of course, our host to this podium for this 55-year-old tradition. since irish ambassador john joseph hearne left a box of ireland.s most famous symbol at the white house in 1952, the shamrock exchange has grown to become a festive sign of enduring friendship during this memorable week and an eternal bond between the american people and the people of ireland. now, the irish are one of the strongest and most beautiful threads in our national fabric here in the united states. for centuries, the sons and daughters of ireland have come here from across the atlantic. more than 32 million americans now trace their heritage back to the emerald isle. and i say with a grateful heart and deep humility, i.m one of them. my grandfather, richard michael cowley, stepped off a boat onto ellis island in 1923. and that.s how michael richard pence got to serve in the white house. my grandfather, as the legend of our family says, was told by my great-grandmother that he needed to go to america. she said, there.s a future there for you. he wouldn.t see his mother for 25 years, and he often spoke of their separation with a heavy heart. my grandfather came here, like so many generations of irish americans did, with a dream, but with character and with work ethic and a determination to build a family, a good name. and so he did. my mother, who is 83 years young, bright red hair and blue eyes, is still with us today, and his memory and her influence continues to define my life, the truth is my grandfather was very typical of the millions that would come to these shores. he embodied all that.s best about the irish: sturdy work ethic, faith in god, love of family, patriotism. and that.“those are the enduring contributions of people of irish descent in the history of this country. it.s extraordinary to think of the contributions that the irish have made. in every single american conflict since our revolutionary war, the irish people have enriched america in incalculable ways, and they always will. and when i speak of those character qualities i know that they apply to the two people that we have the privilege of introducing tonight. first is our special guest. it.s my high honor to invite him to the podium, along with our host. so, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the taoiseach of the republic of ireland, enda kenny; his wife fionnuala; and my friend, the 45th president of the united states of america, donald trump. the president. thank you very much. it.s a great honor. taoiseach, mrs. kenny, ambassador anderson, dr. lowe, vice president pence, and distinguished guests: we gather here today in the white house to take part in the traditional shamrock ceremony and to celebrate the strong ties between the united states and a truly great country, ireland. i also want to extend a special welcome to a group of distinguished local political and society leaders.“and they are real leaders.“who are with us from northern ireland.“great people.“including the mayor of belfast and the head of northern ireland civil service.“that.s a lot of power there. [laughter] lord mayor kingston and sir malcolm mckibbin, and it.s wonderful to have you. where are you folks? where are you? where are you? thank you. and they.re going to be having a great open championship very soon. i know that, right? [laughter] at a great course. at a great, great course. st. patrick.s day has become a truly important occasion in the united states, one embraced by americans of all faiths and of all backgrounds. i.ve been to many of them, and we love it. the shamrock ceremony is a tradition that symbolizes the bond between our two countries. it dates back to 1952 when the irish ambassador to the united states, john joseph hearne, sent a box of shamrocks to a president who did a very good job, harry s. truman. our strong ties go back throughout american history. irish-americans played a vital role in preserving our union during its hour of greatest need. so true. they played a very, very big role. many distinguished themselves in the american civil war with their grit and their bravery and their courage, earning the nickname, the .fighting irish.. and i know a lot about the irish. they fight. they are tough. [laughter] i know a lot. i know more than i.m ever going to tell you. [laughter] and when american armed forces joined the fight in europe during world war ii, 75 years ago, our heroic troops first stepped off ships in belfast harbor in northern ireland. throughout the centuries, hard-working irish americans contributed mightily to america.s innovation and to america.s prosperity. they often overcame great hardship.“and it.s really, i mean, it.s like, the hardship they overcame for us, for our people, is inspiring and really helped a relatively young nation beyond what anyone really understands or knows. so we want to thank you. just an amazing, an amazing history. president john f. kennedy, in an address to the irish parliament, said that .it is that quality of the irish.“that remarkable combination of hope, confidence, and imagination.“that is needed more than ever today.. now, he said that a long time ago, but it.s perhaps even more true today. the words of america.s first irish catholic president ring just as true. we hope confidence.“and i tell you, what we want now is a lot of things, but we need that great irish confidence.“and they are confident people, aren.t they, mike? and we.“and i tell you what, we all want it together to grow in the 21st century. and grow we will, as i say, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. we must have the hope to believe in a better future, the confidence to pursue it, and the imagination to figure out how to get there. a new optimism is sweeping across our nation. you see that when you look at the numbers; the optimism is at the highest level in many, many years. and as america gains renewed strength, ireland will find us to be an ever-faithful partner and an always loyal friend. we will be there for you, and we will be there for you. so thank you for being here. i wish you a very, very happy st. patrick.s day. and god bless you and may god bless ireland and northern ireland. [applause] okay? and may god bless america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much. prime minister kenny. thank you. mr. president, mr. vice president, ladies and gentlemen: it.s a great honor to be back again in the most famous house in the world to celebrate st. patrick.s day, the most special of days for irish men and irish women and those of irish descent the world over. since i had the privilege of being elected as taoiseach in 2011, i.ve had the pleasure of being here in the white house each march to mark the enduring connections between our country and the united states. fionnuala and i would like sincerely to thank president trump for so graciously continuing this great tradition of hospitality which means so much to irish people everywhere. i.m proud, sir, to have the opportunity to contribute to maintaining and developing relations between ireland and the united states, particularly at the beginning of the new era in our country.s relationship following your election, mr. president. let me congratulate you and wish you and your administration the very best as you begin your term of office. this job, the job you hold, is exceptionally demanding and exceptionally difficult. the united states remains the most influential, as well as the most powerful, country in the world. you hold the hopes and the future of america.“and indeed, the world.“in your hands. but let me thank you for giving so much of your time today to this visit. we had an excellent meeting, a first-class meeting this morning in the oval office.“not there very often.“[laughter].“where we discussed a variety of important issues of mutual concern. and i want to assure you, sir, of our commitment to working closely with you and your administration as you face the many challenges up ahead. the ties that bind our two countries are deep and historic. and ireland and the united states have a unique relationship that goes back to the earliest days of the original 13 colonies. irish-born military officers assisted george washington to win that war of independence. indeed, they.ve fought in every war for america since then. and this very house was designed by james hoban from kilkenny, modeled in part after the leinster house in dublin, where the irish parliament has met on our own independence since 1922. it.s fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate st. patrick and his legacy. he, too, of course, was an immigrant. and though he is, of course, the patron saint of ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also a symbol of.“indeed, the patron of.“immigrants. here in america, in your great country, 35 million people claim irish heritage, and the irish have contributed to the economic, social, political, and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. ireland came to america because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, of even food itself, the irish believed. and four decades before lady liberty lifted her lamp, we were the .wretched refuse on the teeming shore.. we believed in the shelter of america, in the compassion of america, in the opportunity of america. we came, and we became americans. we lived the words of john f. kennedy long before he uttered them: we asked not what america could do for us, but what we could do for america. and we still do. we want to give and not to take. we know the irish have built the bridges and the roads, protected the public as firefighters and police officers. we.ve cared for the sick in hospitals, entertained as poets, as singers, and writers, as politicians, as judges and legislators. and as entrepreneurs, they provided hundreds of thousands of jobs for americans, including most recently, in exciting technology companies. two-way trade in goods is approaching $100 billion a year at the moment. irish firms employ 100,000 people across 50 states in the u.s. and we want to build on this for the future. mr. president, ireland is a small island on the edge of europe, a natural bridge between the united states and europe, and as a committed member of the european union and a close friend of the united states, we will work hard with you, mr. president, and with your administration in pursuit of strong and open relations between the united states and the european union, including the strong trade relationships for the mutual benefit of millions of people either side of the atlantic. i believe that the strong people-to-people links that ireland and the united states have developed over the generations will help us in this endeavor. and i wish you and the american people every success and happiness in the future. to irish americans, coast to coast, i say.“in these days especially.“we hold you in our hearts. and tonight i thank you again for your warm hospitality. mr. president, mr. vice president, may i wish you and your lovely families every good wish and blessing on this very special day. indeed, i.m reminded in many ways of the dream of another american president.“which ireland will walk with you with.“when he spoke the words and said, .my dream is of a place and a time where america will once again be seen as the last, best hope of earth.. spoken by abraham lincoln. mr. president, ireland will help you build on that foundation to achieve the ultimate dream. thank you, sir. and god bless you."

   "text": "thank you, chris, for that kind introduction and for your tremendous work on behalf of our second amendment. thank you very much. i want to also thank wayne lapierre for his unflinching leadership in the fight for freedom. wayne, thank you very much. great. i.d also like to congratulate karen handel on her incredible fight in georgia six. the election takes place on june 20. and by the way, on primaries, let.s not have 11 republicans running for the same position, okay? [laughter] it.s too nerve-shattering. she.s totally for the nra, and she.s totally for the second amendment. so get out and vote. she.s running against someone who.s going to raise your taxes to the sky, destroy your health care, and he.s for open borders.“lots of crime.“and he.s not even able to vote in the district that he.s running in. other than that, i think he.s doing a fantastic job, right? [laughter] so get out and vote for karen. also, my friend.“he.s become a friend.“because there.s nobody that does it like lee greenwood. wow. [laughter] lee.s anthem is the perfect description of the renewed spirit sweeping across our country. and it really is, indeed, sweeping across our country. so, lee, i know i speak for everyone in this arena when i say, we are all very proud indeed to be an american. thank you very much, lee. no one was more proud to be american than the beloved patriot.“and you know who i.m talking about.“we remember on gatherings like today, your former five-term president, the late charlton heston. how good was charlton? and i remember charlton; he was out there fighting when maybe a lot of people didn.t want to be fighting. he was out there for a long time. he was a great guy. and it.s truly wonderful to be back in atlanta and back with my friends at the nra. you are my friends, believe me. perhaps some of you remember the last time we were all together. remember that? [laughter] we had a big crowd then too. so we knew something was happening. but it was in the middle of a historic political year and in the middle of a truly historic election. what fun that was: november 8. wasn.t that a great evening? do you remember that evening? remember that? remember they were saying, .we have breaking news: donald trump has won the state of michigan.. they go, .michigan? how did that..“.donald trump has won the state of wisconsin, whoa.. but earlier in the evening, remember: florida, north carolina, south carolina, pennsylvania, all the way up.“we ran up the east coast. and you know, the republicans have a tremendous disadvantage in the electoral college; you know that. and tremendous disadvantage. and to run the whole east coast, and then you go with iowa and ohio, and all of the different states. it was a great evening, one that a lot people will never forget.“a lot of people. [laughter] not going to forget that evening. and remember they said, .there is no path to 270.. for months, i was hearing that. you know, they.re trying to suppress the vote. so they keep saying it; so people say, you know, i really like trump, he loves the second amendment, he loves the nra; i love him, but let.s go to the movie, because he can.t win. because they.re trying to suppress the vote. but they.d say.“i mean, hundreds of times i heard.“there is no.“there.s no route. they.d say it, .there is no route to 270.. and we ended up with 306. so they were right: not 270, 306. that was some evening. big sports fans said that was the single most exciting event they.ve ever seen. that includes super bowls and world series and boxing matches. that was an exciting evening for all of us, and it meant a lot. only one candidate in the general election came to speak to you, and that candidate is now the president of the united states, standing before you again. i have a feeling that in the next election you.re going to be swamped with candidates, but you.re not going to be wasting your time. [laughter] you.ll have plenty of those democrats coming over, and you.re going to say, no, sir, no thank you.“no, ma.am. perhaps ma.am. it may be pocahontas, remember that. [laughter] and she is not big for the nra, that i can tell you. but you came through for me, and i am going to come through for you. i was proud to receive the nra.s earliest endorsement in the history of the organization. and today i am also proud to be the first sitting president to address the nra leadership forum since our wonderful ronald reagan in 1983. and i want to thank each and every one of you, not only for your help electing true friends of the second amendment, but for everything you do to defend our flag and our freedom. with your activism, you helped to safeguard the freedoms of our soldiers who have bled and died for us on the battlefields. and i know we have many veterans in the audience today, and we want to give them a big, big beautiful round of applause. and like i promised, we are doing a really top job already.“99 days.“but already, with the veterans administration, people are seeing a big difference. we are working really hard at the va, and you.re going to see it, and you.re already seeing it. and it.s my honor. i.ve been telling you we.re going to do it, and we.re doing it. thank you. the nra protects in our capitols and legislative houses the freedoms that our servicemembers have won for us on those incredible battlefields. and it.s been a tough fight against those who would go so far as to ban private gun ownership entirely. but i am here to deliver you good news. and i can tell you that wayne and chris have been fighting with me long and hard to make sure that we were with you today, not somebody else with an empty podium. because believe me, the podium would have been empty. they fought long and hard, and i think you folks cannot thank them enough. they were with us all the way, right from the beginning. but we have news that you.ve been waiting for for a long time: the 8-year assault on your second amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. you have a true friend and champion in the white house. no longer will federal agencies be coming after law-abiding gun owners. no longer will the government be trying to undermine your rights and your freedoms as americans. instead, we will work with you, by your side. we will work with the nra to promote responsible gun ownership, to protect our wonderful hunters and their access to the very beautiful outdoors. you met my son; i can tell you, both sons, they love the outdoors. frankly, i think they love the outdoors more than they love, by a long shot, fifth avenue. but that.s okay. and we want to ensure you of the sacred right of self-defense for all of our citizens. when i spoke to this forum last year, our nation was still mourning the loss of a giant, a great defender of the constitution: justice antonin scalia. i promised that if elected, i would nominate a justice who would be faithful and loyal to the constitution. i even went one step further and publicly presented a list of 20 judges from which i would make my selection, and that.s exactly what we did. and by the way, i want to thank, really, heritage. and i want to thank also all of the people that worked with us. where.s leo? is leo around here? where is he? he.s got to be here. where is he? he has been so good. but from.“and also from heritage, jim demint. it.s been amazing. i mean, those people have been fantastic. they.ve been real friends. the federalist people, where are they? are they around here someplace? they really helped us out. i kept my promise, and now, with your help, our brandnew justice.“and he is really something very special.“neil gorsuch, sits on the bench of the united states supreme court. for the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. the last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. now, we won.t get any credit for this, but don.t worry about it; the credit is in the audience, right? the credit is in the audience. all of those people. they won.t give us credit, but it.s been a long time, and we.re very honored. we.ve also taken action to stand up for america.s sportsmen. on their very last full day in office, the previous administration issued an 11th-hour rule to restrict the use of lead ammunition on certain federal lands. have you heard about that, folks? i.m shocked to hear that. you.ve all heard about that. huh? you.ve heard about that. on his first day as secretary of the interior, ryan zinke eliminated the previous administration.s ammunition ban. he.s going to be great. ryan is going to be great. we.ve also moved very quickly to restore something gun owners care about very, very much. it.s called the rule of law. we have made clear that our administration will always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. in fact, countless members of law enforcement are also members of the nra, because our police know that responsible gun ownership saves lives and that the right of self-defense is essential to public safety. do we all agree with that? our police and sheriffs also know that when you ban guns, only the criminals will be armed. for too long, washington has gone after law-abiding gun owners while making life easier for criminals, drug dealers, traffickers, and gang members. ms-13.“you know about ms-13? it.s not pleasant for them anymore, folks. it.s not pleasant for them anymore. that.s a bad group. not pleasant for ms-13. get them the hell out of here, right? get them out. we are protecting the freedoms of law-abiding americans, and we are going after the criminal gangs and cartels that prey on our innocent citizens. and we are really going after them. as members of the nra know well, some of the most important decisions a president can make are appointments, and i.ve appointed people who believe in law, order, and justice. that is why i have selected as your attorney general, number one, a really fine person, a really good man, a man who has spent his entire career fighting crime, supporting the police, and defending the second amendment. for the first time in a long time, you now have a pro-second amendment, tough-on-crime attorney general, and his name is jeff sessions. and attorney general sessions is putting our priorities into action. he.s going after the drug dealers who are peddling their poison all over our streets and destroying our youth. he.s going after the gang members who threaten our children. and he.s fully enforcing our immigration laws in all 50 states. and you know what? it.s about time. heading up the effort to secure america.s borders is a great military general, a man of action: homeland security director [secretary]* john kelly. secretary kelly, who used to be general kelly, is following through on my pledge to protect the borders, remove criminal aliens, and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. we.ve already seen.“listen to this; it.s never happened before, people can.t even believe it. and by the way, we will build the wall no matter how low this number gets or how high this goes. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. you know, they.re trying to use this number against us because we.ve done so unbelievably at the borders already. they.re trying to use it against us. but you need that wall to stop the human trafficking, to stop the drugs, to stop the wrong people. you need the wall. but listen to this: we.ve already seen a 73 percent decrease.“never happened before.“in illegal immigration on the southern border since my election.“73 percent. you see what they.re doing, right? so why do you need a wall? we need a wall. audience member. build the wall! the president. we.ll build the wall. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. don.t even think about it. that.s an easy one. we.re going to build the wall. we need the wall. i said to general kelly, how important is it? he said, very important. it.s that final element. we need the wall. and it.s a wall in certain areas. you, obviously.“where you have these massive physical structures, you don.t need, and where you have certain big rivers and all. but we need a wall, and we.re going to get that wall. and the world is getting the message. they know that our border is no longer open to illegal immigration and that if you try to break in, you.ll be caught, and you.ll be returned to your home. you.re not staying any longer. and if you keep coming back illegally after deportation, you will be arrested, prosecuted, and you will put behind bars. otherwise, it will never end. let.s also remember that immigration security is national security. we.ve seen the attacks from 9/11 to boston to san bernardino. hundreds of individuals from other countries have been charged with terrorism-related offenses in the united states. we spend billions and billions of dollars on security all over the world, but then we allow radical islamic terrorists to enter right through our front door. that.s not going to happen anymore. it.s time to get tough. it.s time we finally got smart. and yes, it.s also time to put america first. and perhaps.“i see all of those beautiful red and white hats-.“but we will never forget our favorite slogan of them all: make america great again. all right? keeping our communities safe and protecting our freedoms also requires the cooperation of our state leaders. we have some incredible pro-second amendment governors here at the nra conference, including governor scott of florida. where is governor scott? where is he? great guy, doing a great job. governor bryant of mississippi. what a wonderful place. governor bryant is here. thank you. governor deal of georgia. and we.re also joined by two people that.“well, one i loved right from the beginning; the other one i really liked, didn.t like, and now like a lot again. [laughter] does that make sense? senator david perdue.“he was from the beginning.“and senator ted cruz.“like, dislike, like. where are they? good guys. good guys. smart cookies. each of these leaders knows that public officials must serve under the constitution, not above it. we all took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states, and that means defending the second amendment. so let me make a simple promise to every one of the freedom-loving americans in the audience today: as your president, i will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. never ever. freedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from god. it was this conviction that stirred the heart of a great american patriot on that day, april, 242 years ago. it was the day that paul revere spread his lexington alarm, the famous warning that .the british are coming, the british are coming.. right? you.ve all heard that, right? the british are coming. now we have other people trying to come, but believe me, they.re not going to be successful. that i can tell you. nothing changes, right, folks? nothing changes. they are not going to be successful. there will be serious hurt on them, not on us. next, came the shot heard around the world and then a ragtag army of god-fearing farmers, frontiersmen, shopkeepers, merchants that stood up to the most powerful army at that time on earth. the most powerful army on earth. but we sometimes forget what inspired those everyday farmers and workers in that great war for independence. many years after the war, a young man asked captain levi preston, aged 91, why he fought alongside his neighbors at concord. was it the stamp act? was it the tea tax? was it a work of philosophy? .no,. the old veteran replied. .then why?. he was asked. .young man,. the captain said, .what we meant in going for those redcoats was this: we always had governed ourselves, and we always meant to. govern ourselves. captain preston.s words are a reminder of what this organization and my administration are all about: the right of a sovereign people to govern their own affairs and govern them properly. we don.t want any longer to be ruled by the bureaucrats in washington or in any other country, for that matter. in america, we are ruled by our citizens. we are ruled by each and every one of you. but we can.t be complacent. these are dangerous times. these are horrible times for certain obvious reasons. but we.re going to make them great times again. every day, we are up against those who would take away our freedoms, restrict our liberties, and even those who want to abolish the second amendment. we must be vigilant. and i know you are all up to the task. since the first generation of americans stood strong at concord, each generation to follow has answered the call to defend freedom in their time. that is why we are here today: to defend freedom for our children. to defend the liberty of all americans. and to defend the right of a free and sovereign people to keep and bear arms. i greatly appreciated your support on november 8, in what will, hopefully, be one of the most important and positive elections for the united states of all time. and to the nra, i can proudly say i will never, ever let you down. thank you. god bless you. god bless our constitution, and god bless america. thank you very much. thank you. thank you."
